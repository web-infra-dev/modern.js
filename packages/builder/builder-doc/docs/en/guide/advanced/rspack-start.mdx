# Rspack Start

[Rspack](https://www.rspack.org/) is a Rust-based web bundler developed by ByteDance Web Infra team, with core architecture aligned with webpack's implementation. Currently, rspack-provider has adapted and validated most of the configuration capabilities in Builder.

Switching to Rspack as the bundler can provide a faster compilation speed.

## Enable Rspack

### Enable in Modern.js framework

We recommend enabling Rspack as the bundler for Modern.js framework through the [Modern.js generator](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/advanced-features/rspack-start.html#initializing-an-rspack-project) if you prefer it over the default webpack bundler.

Of course, you can also access it manually by following the steps below:

1. Install rspack-provider（The version needs to be the same as the modern.js version).

```
pnpm add @modern-js/builder-rspack-provider -D
```

Confirm the modern.js version via package.json or lock file:

```json title=package.json
  "devDependencies": {
    "@modern-js/app-tools": "2.8.0"
  }
```

2. Add statement of use

```ts title=modern.config.ts
import appTools, { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';

export default defineConfig<'rspack'>({
  plugins: [
    appTools({
      bundler: 'experimental-rspack',
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Use Builder in a front-end framework

Integrating rspack-provider into a frontend framework is similar to integrating webpack-provider. You only need to change the dependency from `@modern-js/builder-webpack-provider` to `@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider`.

```ts title=modern.config.ts
import { createBuilder } from '@modern-js/builder';
import { builderRspackProvider } from '@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider';

const provider = builderRspackProvider({
  builderConfig: {
    // some configs
  },
});
```

## Migrating from webpack to rspack

Builder aims to eliminate the main differences between different bundlers and help users migrate at a lower cost. However, due to the different capabilities of each bundler, users still need to be aware of some differences.

This article will introduce the differences between webpack and Rspack from the perspective of Builder. If you need to know more in-depth differences, please refer to the [Rspack documentation](http://www.rspack.org/guide/migrate-from-webpack.html).

### Configuration differences

Currently, most of configuration options in Builder have been adapted for rspack.
Throughout this process, Builder's work includes but is not limited to:

- Replace features that rely on webpack loader/plugin (which are not supported in Rspack) with alternative solutions provided by rspack. For example, use `css/module` instead of css-loader modules.
- Validating and encapsulating webpack plugins such as `@svgr/webpack` and `webpack-bundle-analyzer`;
- Encapsulating Rspack built-in features such as `css` and `minify`.

:::tip
In addition to the above configurations, some of the supported configurations may have differences in their capabilities. For specific differences in configurations, please refer to the corresponding API for each configuration.

### Modify the Rspack Configuration Object

You can use [tools.rspack](/api/config-tools.html#toolsrspack) to modify the Rspack configuration object.

```ts
export default {
  tools: {
    rspack: (config, { env }) => {
      if (env === 'development') {
        config.devtool = 'cheap-module-eval-source-map';
      }
      return config;
    },
  },
};
```

More information about Rspack, please refer to the [Rspack website](https://www.rspack.org/).

### A more flexible way to modify Rspack configuration

Currently, Builder does not provide a flexible way for modifying Rspack config similar to webpack-chain.

If there is a need to add or remove plugins/rules, you can use utility methods such as [prependPlugins](/api/config-tools.html#prependplugins) or [addRules](/api/config-tools.html#addrules).

If there is a need to modify existing plugins/rules, it is recommended to use existing configuration options provided by the builder first.
For example, to modify html configuration, you should first check if there is a corresponding configuration item under [html config](/api/config-html.html). If the html config does not support the required modifications, the [tools.htmlPlugin](/api/config-tools.html#toolshtmlplugin) configuration option can be used.
