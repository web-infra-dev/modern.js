## Bundler

Refers to module bundlers such as `webpack`, `rspack`.

The main goal of bundlers is to bundle JavaScript, CSS and other files together, and the bundled files can be used in the browser, Node.js or other environments. When bundler processes the Web application, it builds a dependency graph and then combines every module into one or more bundles.

## Rspack

Rspack is a high performance rust-based JavaScript bundler developed by the ByteDance Web Infra team that offers strong interoperability with the Webpack ecosystem and low-cost integration, enabling optimised performance and efficient collaboration between the two tools.

Please refer to [Rspack Documentation](https://rspack.dev/) for details.

## Builder

Build Engine. The goal of Builder is to "reuse the best practices of build tools".

Bundlers are low-level, if we build a project based on webpack, we need to fully understand the webpack config and many webpack plugins and loaders, then spend a lot of time to combine them.

Builder is a out-of-box build tools. By using Builder, you can quickly gain the ability to build a modern web application.

The layers inside the Builder are as follows:

Currently there are two Providers:

- `@modern-js/builder-webpack-provider`: Based on webpack.
- `@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider`: Based on rspack.
