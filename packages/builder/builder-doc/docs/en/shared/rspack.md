:::tip What is Rspack
[Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev/) is a high performance Rust-based JavaScript bundler that offers strong interoperability with the webpack ecosystem, enabling faster development cycles and efficient collaboration between the two tools.

Rspack's build performance is significantly better than Webpack, not only due to the language benefits of Rust, but also due to its parallel architecture and incremental compilation features. Benchmarking has shown that Rspack can deliver a 5-10x improvement in compilation performance.
