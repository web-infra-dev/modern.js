- **Type:**

```ts
type SRIOptions =
  | {
      hashFuncNames?: string[];
      enabled?: 'auto' | boolean;
      hashLoading?: 'eager' | 'lazy';
    }
  | boolean;
```

- **Default:** `undefined`
- **Bundler:** `only support webpack`

Adding an integrity attribute (`integrity`) to sub-resources introduced by HTML allows the browser to verify the integrity of the introduced resource, thus preventing tampering with the downloaded resource.

Enabling this option will set the webpack [output.crossOriginLoading](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#outputcrossoriginloading) configuration option to `anonymous`.

#### Introduce SRI

Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that resources they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched resource must match.

For script tags, the result is to refuse to execute the code; for CSS links, the result is not to load the styles.

For more on subresource integrity, see [Subresource Integrity - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).

#### Example

By default, `SRI` is not turned on, and when it is, its default configuration is as follows:

```js
{
  hashFuncNames: ['sha384'];
  enabled: "auto",
  hashLoading: "eager",
}
```

You can customize the configuration options according to your own needs:

```js
export default {
  security: {
    sri: {
      hashFuncNames: ['sha-256'],
      enabled: true,
      hashLoading: 'lazy',
    },
  },
};
```
