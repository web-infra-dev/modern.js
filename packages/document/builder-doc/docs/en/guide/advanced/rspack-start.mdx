# Using Rspack

This document will show you how to enable Rspack build mode in the Builder.

import Rspack from '@en/shared/rspack-tip.mdx';

<Rspack />

## Enable Rspack

### Enable in Modern.js framework

We recommend enabling Rspack as the bundler for Modern.js framework through the [Modern.js generator](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/advanced-features/rspack-start.html#initializing-an-rspack-project) if you prefer it over the default webpack bundler.

Of course, you can also access it manually by following the steps below:

1. Install `@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider` (The version needs to be the same as the Modern.js version).

```
pnpm add @modern-js/builder-rspack-provider -D
```

Confirm the Modern.js version via package.json or lock file:

```json title=package.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@modern-js/app-tools": "2.8.0"
  }
}
```

2. Declare the use of Rspack in the Modern.js configuration file:

```diff title=modern.config.ts
import appTools, { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';

+ export default defineConfig<'rspack'>({
  plugins: [
    appTools({
+     bundler: 'experimental-rspack',
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Use Builder in a front-end framework

Integrating rspack-provider into a frontend framework is similar to integrating webpack-provider. You only need to change the dependency from `@modern-js/builder-webpack-provider` to `@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider`.

```ts title=modern.config.ts
import { createBuilder } from '@modern-js/builder';
import { builderRspackProvider } from '@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider';

const provider = builderRspackProvider({
  builderConfig: {
    // some configs
  },
});
```

## Migrating from webpack to Rspack

Builder aims to eliminate the main differences between different bundlers and help users migrate at a lower cost. However, due to the different capabilities of each bundler, you still need to be aware of some differences.

This article will introduce the differences between webpack and Rspack from the perspective of Builder. If you need to know more in-depth differences, please refer to the [Rspack documentation](http://rspack.dev/guide/migrate-from-webpack.html).

### Builder configuration differences

Currently, most of configuration options in Builder have been adapted for Rspack.
Throughout this process, Builder's work includes but is not limited to:

- Replace features that rely on webpack loader/plugin (which are not supported in Rspack) with alternative solutions provided by Rspack. For example, use `css/module` instead of `css-loader` modules.
- Validating and encapsulating webpack plugins such as `@svgr/webpack` and `webpack-bundle-analyzer`;
- Encapsulating Rspack built-in features such as `css` and `minify`.

:::tip
In addition to the above configurations, some of the supported configurations may have differences in their capabilities. For specific differences in configurations, please refer to the corresponding API for each configuration.
:::

### Migrating from webpackChain to bundlerChain

Builder supports modifying Rspack config via [bundlerChain](/api/config-tools.html#toolsbundlerchain). configurations modified via bundlerChain will take effect on both webpack and Rspack builds.

:::tip
The bundlerChain only provides consistent api modification for Rspack & webpack configurations, the actual plugin / loader availability depends on the actual Rspack / webpack support.
:::

### CHAIN_ID differences

Because of some implementation differences between webpack and Rspack, there are some differences in the rules configuration.

You can see all the rules that are supported in both Rspack & webpack via [tools.bundlerChain#CHAIN_ID](/api/config-tools.html#chain_id).

### Modify the Rspack Configuration Object

BundlerChain only supports modifying the Rspack & webpack intersection config, more Rspack-exclusive features need to be modified via [tools.rspack](/api/config-tools.html#toolsrspack).

Before modify the Rspack configuration object, you may should know [the config diff between Rspack and Webapck](https://www.rspack.dev/guide/config-diff.html).

```ts
export default {
  tools: {
    rspack: (config, { env }) => {
      if (env === 'development') {
        config.devtool = 'cheap-module-eval-source-map';
      }
      return config;
    },
  },
};
```
