# Using Rspack

This document will show you how to enable Rspack build mode in the Builder.

import Rspack from '@en/shared/rspack-tip.mdx';

<Rspack />

## Enable Rspack

### Enable in Modern.js framework

We recommend enabling Rspack as the bundler for Modern.js framework through the [Modern.js generator](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/advanced-features/rspack-start.html#initializing-an-rspack-project) if you prefer it over the default webpack bundler.

Of course, you can also access it manually by following the steps below:

1. Install `@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider` (The version needs to be the same as the Modern.js version).

```
pnpm add @modern-js/builder-rspack-provider -D
```

Confirm the Modern.js version via package.json or lock file:

```json title=package.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@modern-js/app-tools": "2.8.0"
  }
}
```

2. Declare the use of Rspack in the Modern.js configuration file:

```diff title=modern.config.ts
import appTools, { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';

+ export default defineConfig<'rspack'>({
  plugins: [
    appTools({
+     bundler: 'experimental-rspack',
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Use Builder in a front-end framework

Integrating rspack-provider into a frontend framework is similar to integrating webpack-provider. You only need to change the dependency from `@modern-js/builder-webpack-provider` to `@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider`.

```ts title=modern.config.ts
import { createBuilder } from '@modern-js/builder';
import { builderRspackProvider } from '@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider';

const provider = builderRspackProvider({
  builderConfig: {
    // some configs
  },
});
```

## Migrating from webpack to Rspack

Builder aims to eliminate the main differences between different bundlers and help users migrate at a lower cost. However, due to the different capabilities of each bundler, you still need to be aware of some differences.

This article will introduce the differences between webpack and Rspack from the perspective of Builder. If you need to know more in-depth differences, please refer to the [Rspack documentation](http://rspack.dev/guide/migrate-from-webpack.html).

### 1. Builder configuration differences

Currently, most of configuration options in Builder have been adapted for Rspack.
Throughout this process, Builder's work includes but is not limited to:

- Replace features that rely on webpack loader/plugin (which are not supported in Rspack) with alternative solutions provided by Rspack. For example, use `css/module` instead of `css-loader` modules.
- Validating and encapsulating webpack plugins such as `@svgr/webpack` and `webpack-bundle-analyzer`;
- Encapsulating Rspack built-in features such as `css` and `minify`.

#### Source Config

> Source code parsing and compilation related configurations in Builder.

Unsupported configurations and capabilities include:

- [source.include](/api/config-source.html#sourceinclude)
- [source.exclude](/api/config-source.html#sourceexclude)
- [source.moduleScopes](/api/config-source.html#sourcemodulescopes)

#### Html Config

> HTML related configurations in Builder.

All configurations and capabilities under html are available within rspack.

#### Security Config

> Security related configurations in Builder.

All configurations and capabilities under security are **not supported** for use within rspack.

#### Dev Config

> Dev related configurations in Builder.

All configurations and capabilities under dev are available within rspack.

#### Output Config

> Output related configurations in Builder.

Unsupported configurations and capabilities include:

- [output.disableCssExtract](/api/config-output.html#outputdisablecssextract)
- [output.disableSourcemap.css](/api/config-output.html#outputdisablesourcemap)
- [output.enableCssModuleTSDeclaration](/api/config-output.html#outputenablecssmoduletsdeclaration)
- [output.enableInlineScripts](/api/config-output.html#outputenableinlinescripts)
- [output.legalComments.inline](/api/config-output.html#outputlegalcomments)
- [output.polyfill.usage](/api/config-output.html#usage)

#### Experiments Config

> Experimental related configurations in the Builder

All configurations and capabilities under experiments are **not supported** for use within rspack.

#### Performance Config

> Performance related configurations in Builder.

Unsupported configurations and capabilities include:

- [performance.profile](/api/config-performance.html#performanceprofile)
- [performance.removeMomentLocale](/api/config-performance.html#performanceremovemomentlocale)
- [performance.buildCache](/api/config-performance.html#performancebuildcache)

#### Tools Config

> Low-level tools configurations in Builder.

Unsupported configurations and capabilities include:

- [tools.terser](/api/config-tools.html#toolsterser)
- [tools.cssExtract](/api/config-tools.html#toolscssextract)
- [tools.cssLoader](/api/config-tools.html#toolscssloader)
- [tools.devServer.devMiddleware](/api/config-tools.html#devmiddleware)
- [tools.inspector](/api/config-tools.html#toolsinspector)
- [tools.minifyCss](/api/config-tools.html#toolsminifycss)
- [tools.styleLoader](/api/config-tools.html#toolsstyleloader)
- [tools.styledComponents](/api/config-tools.html#toolsstyledcomponents)
- [tools.tsLoader](/api/config-tools.html#toolstsloader)
- [tools.webpack](/api/config-tools.html#toolswebpack)
- [tools.webpackChain](/api/config-tools.html#toolswebpackchain)

:::tip
In addition to the above configurations, some of the supported configurations may have differences in their capabilities. For specific differences in configurations, please refer to the corresponding API for each configuration.
:::

### 2. Migrating from webpackChain to bundlerChain

Builder supports modifying Rspack config via [bundlerChain](/api/config-tools.html#toolsbundlerchain). configurations modified via bundlerChain will take effect on both webpack and Rspack builds.

```diff
export default {
  tools: {
-   webpackChain: (chain, { env }) => {
+   bundlerChain: (chain, { env }) => {
      if (env === 'development') {
        chain.devtool('cheap-module-eval-source-map');
      }
    },
  },
};
```

:::tip
The bundlerChain only provides consistent api modification for Rspack & webpack configurations, the actual plugin / loader availability depends on the actual Rspack / webpack support.
:::

#### CHAIN_ID differences

Because of some implementation differences between webpack and Rspack, there are some differences in the rules configuration.

You can see all the rules that are supported in both Rspack & webpack via [tools.bundlerChain#CHAIN_ID](/api/config-tools.html#chain_id).

### 3. Migrating from tools.webpack to tools.rspack

BundlerChain only supports modifying the Rspack & webpack intersection config, more Rspack-exclusive features need to be modified via [tools.rspack](/api/config-tools.html#toolsrspack).

Before modify the Rspack configuration object, you may should know [the config diff between Rspack and Webapck](https://www.rspack.dev/guide/config-diff.html).

```diff
export default {
  tools: {
-   webppack: (config, { env }) => {
+   rspack: (config, { env }) => {
      if (env === 'development') {
        config.devtool = 'cheap-module-eval-source-map';
      }
      return config;
    },
  },
};
```

More information about Rspack, please refer to the [Rspack website](https://www.rspack.dev/).

### 4. Babel Configuration Migration

By default, Rspack uses SWC for transpilation and compression. Therefore, when using Rspack for building, babel-loader is not loaded by default.

For most common Babel plugins, you can find corresponding alternatives in Rspack, and there are also corresponding compatible configuration options in Builder.

| Babel Plugin                                    | Rspack Configuration                                                                      | Builder Configuration                                                                                                        |

:::Tip
When using Rspack for building, you can still configure Babel plugins through [tools.babel](/api/config-tools.html#toolsbabel), but this will result in additional compilation overhead, which may slow down the Rspack build to some extent.
:::

### 5. SWC Configuration Support

Rspack has built-in support for some swc configurations, such as builtins.react, which can be referred to in [Builtins](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins.html).

Adding swc plugins and more custom configurations is not currently supported in Rspack. Relevant requirements can be tracked through the corresponding [issue](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack/issues/3067).

### 6. Webpack Plugin Migration

Currently, only a limited number of webpack plugins are compatible with Rspack.

If you are using the following plugins (or indirect dependencies) in your project, you will need to temporarily remove them or use alternative solutions, otherwise you won't be able to switch to the Rspack build:

- webpack-retry-chunk-load-plugin：use [output.assetsRetry](/api/config-output.html#outputassetsretry) instead.
- webpack.ProviderPlugin：use [builtins.provide](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins.html#builtinsprovide) instead.
- webpack.DefinePlugin：use [builtins.define](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins.html#builtinsdefine) instead.
- copy-webpack-plugin：use [builtins.copy](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins.html#builtinscopy) instead.
- banner-plugin：use [builtins.banner](https://www.rspack.dev/config/builtins.html#builtinsbanner) instead.
- webpack.IgnorePlugin
- webpack.ContextReplacementPlugin
- ...

Detailed plugin support can be found at: [Plugin compatibility](https://www.rspack.dev/guide/plugin-compat.html).

The plugins not listed can be judged according to [Rspack Plugin API](https://www.rspack.dev/api/plugin-api.html).
