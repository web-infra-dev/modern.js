# Use Builder CLI

Modern.js Builder provides a lightweight CLI tool that includes basic commands such as `dev` and `build`. It is primarily used for building non-React projects.

- For React projects, we recommend using the Modern.js framework directly. Please refer to [Modern.js - Quick Start](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/get-started/quick-start.html) for more information.
- For non-React projects, such as developing a Vue project, you can use the Builder CLI tool to build your project.

## Install

You need to install two packages:

- `@modern-js/builder-cli`: the CLI tool for Builder, providing basic CLI commands and automatically loading the installed Provider in the current project.
- `@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider`: To provide the building capabilities based on Rspack.

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @modern-js/builder-cli @modern-js/builder-rspack-provider -D" />

if you want to use webpack instead of Rspack, you can replace the `@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider` with `@modern-js/builder-webpack-provider`:

## Commands

Builder CLI provides the following commands to help you quickly start a development server, build production-ready code, and more.

### builder dev

The `builder dev` command is used to start a local development server and compile the source code in the development environment.

```bash
Usage: builder dev [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            display help for command
```

### builder build

The `builder build` command will build the outputs for production in the `dist/` directory by default.

```bash
Usage: builder build [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            display help for command
```

### builder serve

The `builder serve` command is used to preview the production build outputs locally. Note that you need to execute the `builder build` command beforehand to generate the corresponding outputs.

```bash
Usage: builder serve [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            display help for command
```

## Configuration

Builder CLI will read the `builder.config.ts` configuration file located in the root directory of your project by default. You can use [all the configuration options](/api/index) provided by Builder in the configuration file.

```ts title="builder.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/builder-cli';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    disableTsChecker: true,
  },
});
```

When you use Rspack as the bundler, there are some differences in configuration types between webpack and Rspack. Therefore, you need to specify the `'rspack'` generic for `defineConfig`:

```diff title="builder.config.ts"
- export default defineConfig({
+ export default defineConfig<'rspack'>({
  // ...
});
```

## Build Entry

By default, Builder CLI uses `src/index.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)` as the build entry. You can modify the build entry using the `source.entries` configuration option.

- **Type:**

```ts
type Entries = Record<string, string>;
```

- **Default:**

```ts
const defaultEntry = {
  index: 'src/index.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)',
};
```

- **Example:**

```ts title="builder.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/builder-cli';

export default defineConfig({
  source: {
    entries: {
      foo: './src/pages/foo/index.ts',
      bar: './src/pages/bar/index.ts',
    },
  },
});
```

## Registering Plugins

You can register Builder plugins using the `builderPlugins` option in `builder.config.ts`.

For example, to register a Vue plugin:

```ts title="builder.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/builder-cli';
import { builderPluginVue } from '@modern-js/builder-plugin-vue';

export default defineConfig({
  builderPlugins: [builderPluginVue()],
});
```
