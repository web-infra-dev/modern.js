# Use Builder CLI

Modern.js Builder provides a lightweight CLI tool that includes basic commands such as `dev` and `build`. It is primarily used for building non-React projects.

If your project is not based on the React, for example, if you are developing a Vue project, you can use the Builder CLI tool to build your project.

## Install

You need to install two packages:

- `@modern-js/builder-cli` is the CLI tool for Builder, providing basic CLI commands and automatically loading the installed Provider in the current project.
- `@modern-js/builder-webpack-provider` or `@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider`, they are Providers for Builder, offering build capabilities based on webpack or Rspack.

```bash
# Using webpack for bundling
pnpm add @modern-js/builder-cli @modern-js/builder-webpack-provider -D

# Using Rspack for bundling
pnpm add @modern-js/builder-cli @modern-js/builder-rspack-provider -D
```

## Commands

Builder CLI provides the following commands to help you quickly start a development server, build production-ready code, and more.

### builder dev

The `builder dev` command is used to start a local development server and compile the source code in the development environment.

```bash
Usage: builder dev [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            display help for command
```

### builder build

The `builder build` command will build the outputs for production in the `dist/` directory by default.

```bash
Usage: builder build [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            display help for command
```

### builder serve

The `builder serve` command is used to preview the production build outputs locally. Note that you need to execute the `builder build` command beforehand to generate the corresponding outputs.

```bash
Usage: builder serve [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            display help for command
```

## Configuration

Builder CLI will read the `builder.config.ts` configuration file located in the root directory of your project by default. You can use [all the configuration options](<(/api/index)>) provided by Builder in the configuration file.

```ts title="builder.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/builder-cli';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    disableTsChecker: true,
  },
});
```

When you use Rspack as the bundler, there are some differences in configuration types between webpack and Rspack. Therefore, you need to specify the `'rspack'` generic for `defineConfig`:

```diff title="builder.config.ts"
- export default defineConfig({
+ export default defineConfig<'rspack'>({
  // ...
});
```

## Build Entry

By default, Builder CLI uses `src/index.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)` as the build entry. You can modify the build entry using the `source.entries` configuration option.

- **Type:**

```ts
type Entries = Record<string, string>;
```

- **Default:**

```ts
const defaultEntry = {
  index: 'src/index.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)',
};
```

- **Example:**

```ts title="builder.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/builder-cli';

export default defineConfig({
  source: {
    entries: {
      foo: './src/pages/foo/index.ts',
      bar: './src/pages/bar/index.ts',
    },
  },
});
```
