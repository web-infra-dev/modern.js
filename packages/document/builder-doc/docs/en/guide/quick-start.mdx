# Quick Start

## Environment preparation

import NodeVersion from '@en/shared/nodeVersion.md';

<NodeVersion />

## Use the Modern.js Framework

**The Modern.js Framework uses Modern.js Builder as its build tool by default**. If you are a business developer, you do not need to manually install Builder, just create a Modern.js project and use all the features provided by Builder.

```bash
npx @modern-js/create@latest my-app
```

Please refer to [Modern.js - Introduction](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/get-started/introduction.html) and [Modern.js - Quick Start](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/get-started/quick-start.html) to learn how to use Modern.js framework.

:::tip About the documentation
Modern.js framework documentation and Modern.js Builder documentation are deployed under two separate sites. If you encounter any build-related problems while using the Modern.js framework, you can always refer to the documentation of Modern.js Builder to find solutions.

## Usse the Builder CLI Tool

Modern.js Builder provides a lightweight CLI tool that includes basic commands such as `dev` and `build`. It is primarily used for building non-React projects.

If your project is not based on the React, for example, if you are developing a Vue project, you can use the Builder CLI tool to build your project.

Please refer to [Use Builder CLI](/guide/basic/builder-cli) for more information on how to use it.

## Use Builder in a Front-end Framework

If you are developing a front-end framework, you can use Builder by following these steps:

### 1. Install Builder

You need to install two packages:

- `@modern-js/builder`: This is the core package of Builder, which exports the core API of Builder.
- `@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider`: To provide the building capabilities based on Rspack.

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @modern-js/builder @modern-js/builder-rspack-provider -D" />

if you want to use webpack instead of Rspack, you can replace the `@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider` with `@modern-js/builder-webpack-provider`:

> When performing a version upgrade, please ensure that the Builder and Provider packages you install are of the same version.

### 2. Create Builder Instance

There are two steps to creating a Builder instance:

First you need to initialize the Builder Provider and pass in the `builderConfig` config object. Builder provides a lot of configs that allow you to customize the build behavior. At this point, you don't need to know the specific content of the config, just pass in an empty object. You can find all available configs in [API - config](/en/api/#config).

- Initialize the Rspack Provider:

```ts
import { createBuilder } from '@modern-js/builder';
import { builderWebpackProvider } from '@modern-js/builder-webpack-provider';

const provider = builderWebpackProvider({
  builderConfig: {
    // some configs
  },
});
```

- Initialize the Rspack Provider：

```ts
import { createBuilder } from '@modern-js/builder';
import { builderRspackProvider } from '@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider';

const provider = builderRspackProvider({
  builderConfig: {
    // some configs
  },
});
```

After getting the provider instance, you can call the `createBuilder` method to create a Builder instance object:

```ts
const builder = await createBuilder(provider, {
  entry: {
    index: './src/index.ts',
  },
});
```

Except the `entry` option, the `createBuilder` method also provides some other options, which you can learn more about in [API - createBuilder](/en/api/builder-core.html#createbuilder).

### 3. Call Builder Instance Method

The Builder instance provides some methods, which you can use it according to the usage scenarios.

To start local development, it is recommended to use the [builder.startDevServer](/en/api/builder-instance.html#builder-startdevserver) method, which will start a local Dev Server.

```ts
await builder.startDevServer();
```

After successfully starting Dev Server, you can see the following logs:

```bash
info    Starting dev server...

  > Local:    http://localhost:8081
  > Network:  http://192.168.0.1:8081
```

To deploy the App to production environment, it is recommended to use the [builder.build](/en/api/builder-instance.html#builder-build) method, which will build the production outputs.

```ts
await builder.build();
```

> For more introduction of Builder instance methods, please read the [Builder Instance](/en/api/builder-instance.html) chapter.

After completing the above three steps, you have learned the basic usage of Builder. Next, you can customize the build process through the Builder plugin and Builder configs.
