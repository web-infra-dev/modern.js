[Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/) is an Rspack-based build tool for the web. The main goal of Rsbuild is to provide out-of-the-box build capabilities for Rspack users, allowing developers to start a web project with zero configuration.

Rsbuild integrates high-performance Rust-based tools from the community, including Rspack and SWC, to provide first-class build speed and development experience.
