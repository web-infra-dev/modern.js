[Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev/) is a high performance JavaScript bundler based on Rust, with interoperability with the webpack ecosystem, allowing it to be integrated into webpack projects at a low cost while providing better build performance.

Compared to webpack, Rspack has significantly improved build performance, thanks not only to the language advantages brought by Rust, but also to its parallel architecture and incremental compilation features. Benchmarking has shown that Rspack can provide 5-10 times better compilation performance.
