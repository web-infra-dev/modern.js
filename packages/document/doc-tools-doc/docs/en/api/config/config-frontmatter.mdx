# Front Matter Config

```

```

The meaning of each `pageType` config is as follows:

- `home`: **Home page**, including the layout content of the top navigation bar and home page.
- `doc`: **Doc page**, including top navigation bar, left sidebar, body content, and outline bar on the right.

  };
  actions: {
    text: string;
