# Conventional Route

## What is it?

Modern.js Doc uses file system routing, and the file path of the page is simply mapped to the routing path, which makes the routing of the entire project very intuitive.

For example, if there is a file named `foo.md` in the `docs` directory, the routing path for that file will be `/foo`.

## Mapping Rules

Modern.js Doc automatically scans the root directory and all subdirectories, and maps file paths to route paths. For example, if you have the following file structure:

```bash
docs
├── foo
│   └── bar.md
└── foo.md
```

Then `bar.md` will be routed to `/foo/bar`, and `foo.md` will be routed to `/foo`.

The specific mapping rules are as follows:

| file path | route path
|
| --------------- | ---------- |
| `index.md` | `/` |
| `/foo.md` | `/foo` |
| `/foo/bar.md` | `/foo/bar` |
| `/zoo/index.md` | `/zoo` |

## Custom Behavior

If you want to customize the routing behavior, you can use the `route` field in the configuration file. For example:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/doc-tools';

export default defineConfig({
  route: {
    // These files will be excluded from the routing (support glob pattern)
    exclude: ['custom.tsx', 'component/**/*']
    // These files will be included in the routing (support glob pattern)
    include: ['other-dir/**/*'],
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

We recommend that you place documentation files in the `docs` directory to make your project more clear. For non-documentation content, such as custom components, util functions, etc., they can be maintained outside the `docs` directory. For example:

```bash
docs
└── foo.mdx
src
├── components
│   └── CustomComponent.tsx
└── utils
    └── utils.ts
```
