# Introduction

## Position

Modern.js Doc is a front-end framework for **document site scenarios**, and its goal is to provide developers with a simple, efficient, and scalable document site solution.

The original intention of this document framework is to provide a ducument solution for the company's internal technical products, and to meet some special internal needs, such as `cross-site search service`. However, for common document site building needs, we have also provided relatively complete support, such as support for `i18n`, `full-text search`, `custom themes`, and so on.

At the same time, the framework is based on [Rspack](https://rspack.dev) which is a Rust-based build tool.So it has a very fast build speed, and take you only a few seconds to build a document site.

## Features

### Support MDX

Modern.js Doc is based on [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to extend the Markdown syntax.It supports the use of React components in Markdown, and supports the use of JSX syntax in Markdown, which is more flexible in syntax.

Please refer to the syntax details in [Use MDX](/guide/basic/use-mdx)

### Support Full-Text Search

Based on the [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) search engine, it provides out-of-the-box document search capabilities.

### Support I18n

Built-in i18n support, supports multi-language switching, and supports multi-language content search.You can refer to [I18n](/guide/default-theme/i18n) for details.

### Code Block Syntax Highlighting

Based on [PrismJS](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) for runtime code coloring, it supports multiple code language highlighting. For example:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
import { docTools, defineConfig } from '@modern-js/doc-tools';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  doc: {
    root: path.join(__dirname, 'docs'),
  },
  plugins: [docTools()],
});
```

### Auto Layout Generation

There are multiple built-in layout components, such as `Top Navigation Bar` and `Left Sidebar`, that can be automatically generated through config files. For details, please refer to [Auto Nav/Sidebar](/guide/basic/auto-nav-sidebar).

At the same time, you can also customize the layout type by configuring `pageType`. For more information, please refer to [pageType](/api/config/config-frontmatter.html#pagetype).
