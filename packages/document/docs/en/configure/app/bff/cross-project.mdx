<EnableBFFCaution />

This configuration is used to enable BFF cross-project invocation functionality. When enabled, the current project can be used as a BFF producer, generating an SDK that can be directly called by other projects.

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  bff: {
    crossProject: true,
  },
});
```

For detailed configuration and usage of BFF cross-project invocation, please refer to the [BFF Cross-Project Invocation Guide](/guides/advanced-features/bff/cross-project.html).
