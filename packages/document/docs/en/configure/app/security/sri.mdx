# security.sri

- **Type**

```ts
type SriOptions = {
  hashFuncNames?: [string, ...string[]];
  enabled?: 'auto' | true | false;
};
```

- **Default:** `undefined`

Adding an `integrity` attribute to `<script>` and `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags introduced by HTML allows the browser to verify the integrity of the introduced resource, thus preventing tampering with the downloaded resource.

:::info
For a specific introduction to SRI, you can refer to [Rsbuild security.sri](https://rsbuild.rs/zh/config/security/sri).

This configuration type is not completely consistent with Rsbuild and will be automatically converted during the build process.
