# server.rsc

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

Enable React Server Components (RSC) configuration.

When set to `true`, enables React Server Components support in Modern.js. This allows components to be rendered on the server, providing better performance and developer experience.

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    rsc: true,
  },
});
```

:::tip Prerequisites
Before enabling RSC, ensure:
1. React and React DOM are upgraded to version 19 (recommended 19.2.3 or above)
2. Install the `react-server-dom-webpack` dependency

:::

For more information about using RSC, see the [React Server Components guide](/guides/basic-features/render/rsc).
