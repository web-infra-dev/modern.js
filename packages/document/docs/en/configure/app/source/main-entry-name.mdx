# source.mainEntryName

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** `'main'`

This option is used to configure the main entry name of Modern.js.

By default, the default main entry name of Modern.js is `main`. When using a single entry or the entry name is the same as the `name` field in `package.json`, the corresponding entry will be used as the main entry. This configuration can be used to modify the name of the main entry.

For example, change the main entry name to index:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  source: {
    mainEntryName: 'index',
  },
});
```

After building, the corresponding HTML output path will be changed to `dist/html/index/index.html`.

:::info
When the main entry name is modified, other `**ByEntries` configurations also need to be adjusted to use the modified entry name.
