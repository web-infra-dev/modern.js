# Cross-Project Invocation

Based on the BFF architecture, Modern.js provides cross-project invocation capabilities, allowing BFF functions created in one project to be invoked by other projects through integrated calls, enabling function sharing and feature reuse across projects.
Cross-project invocation consists of **producer** and **consumer** sides. The producer is responsible for creating and providing BFF services while generating integrated invocation SDK, and the consumer initiates requests through these SDK.

## BFF Producer

Upgrade Modern.js dependencies to version x.64.4 or higher, then enable cross-project invocation via configuration. Projects with BFF capabilities enabled can act as BFF producers, or you can create standalone BFF applications.
When executing `dev` or `build`, the following artifacts for consumers will be automatically generated:
- API functions under the `dist/client` directory
- Runtime configuration functions under the `dist/runtime` directory
- Interface exports defined in `exports` field of `package.json`
- File list for npm publication specified in `files` field of `package.json`

### Existing BFF-enabled Projects

1. Enable Cross-Project Invocation

Ensure the current project has BFF enabled with API files defined under `api/lambda`. Add the following configuration:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  bff: {
    crossProject: true,
  }
});
```

2. Generate SDK Type Files

To provide type hints for the integrated invocation SDK, enable the `declaration` option in TypeScript configuration:

```ts title="tsconfig.json"
"compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
}
```

## BFF Consumer

:::info
You can initiate requests to BFF producers from projects using any framework via the SDK.

### Intra-Monorepo Invocation

When producer and consumer are in the same Monorepo, directly import the SDK. API functions reside under `${package_name}/api`:

```ts title="src/routes/page.tsx"
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { get as hello } from '${package_name}/api/hello';

export default () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    hello().then(setText);
  }, []);
  return <div>{text}</div>;
};
```

### Cross-Project Invocation

When producer and consumer are in separate repositories, publish the BFF producer as an npm package. The invocation method remains the same as intra-Monorepo.

### Domain Configuration and Extensions

For real-world scenarios requiring custom BFF service domains, use the configuration function:

```ts title="src/routes/page.tsx"
import { configure } from '${package_name}/runtime';

configure({
  setDomain() {
    return 'https://your-bff-api.com';
  },
});
```

The `configure` function from `${package_name}/runtime` supports domain configuration via `setDomain`, interceptors, and custom SDK. When extending both **current project** and **cross-project** SDK on the same page:

```ts title="src/routes/page.tsx"
import { configure } from '${package_name}/runtime';
import { configure as innerConfigure } from '@modern-js/plugin-bff/client';
import axios from 'axios';

configure({
    setDomain() {
        return 'https://your-bff-api.com';
    },
});

innerConfigure({
  async request(...config: Parameters<typeof fetch>) {
    const [url, params] = config;
    const res = await axios({
      url: url as string,
      method: params?.method as Method,
      data: params?.body,
      headers: {
        'x-header': 'innerConfigure',
      },
    });
    return res.data;
  },
});
```
