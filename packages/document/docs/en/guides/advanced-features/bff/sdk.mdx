# Extend Request SDK

The unified invocation of BFF functions is isomorphic in both CSR and SSR. The request SDK encapsulated by Modern.js relies on the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) on the browser side, on the server side, prioritize using the [built-in fetch function](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/fetch), if it's not supported, then fall back to [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch). However, in actual business scenarios, additional processing may be required for requests or responses, such as:

- Writing authentication information in the request headers
- Uniform handling of response data or errors
- Using other methods to send requests when the native fetch function is unavailable on specific platforms

To address these scenarios, Modern.js provides the `configure` function, which offers a series of extension capabilities. You can use it to configure SSR passthrough request headers, add interceptors, or customize the request SDK.

:::caution Note
The `configure` function needs to be called before all BFF requests are sent to ensure that the default request configuration is overridden.
:::

```tsx title="routes/page.tsx"
import { configure } from '@modern-js/plugin-bff/client';

configure({
  // ...
})

const Index = () => <div>Hello world</div>
export default Index;
```

## Configuring SSR Passthrough Request Headers

When using both Modern.js SSR and BFF, it is often necessary to pass some request header information from the SSR page request to the BFF service.

For example, imagine a project with a page URL `https://website.com`. This page is rendered using SSR, and in the component, it will call the API endpoint `https://website.com/api/info`, which requires the user's cookie information for authentication. The page needs to pass the `cookie` of the SSR page request to the BFF when requesting this API endpoint.

Currently, the following request headers are automatically passed through in Modern.js:

```ts
['cookie', 'user-agent', 'x-tt-logid', 'x-tt-stress']
```

You can configure additional request headers using `configure`. For example, in the following snippet, Modern.js will automatically pass the `x-uid` information from the SSR page request to the BFF service:

```tsx
configure({
  allowedHeaders: ['x-uid']
})
```

## Adding Interceptors

In some business scenarios, you may need to handle requests and responses uniformly. This can be achieved by **configuring interceptors**:

```tsx
configure({
  // The `request` here is the default request tool for unified invocation. The `interceptor` function needs to return a new request.
  // The output of the new request must be the parsed body result.
  interceptor(request) {
    return async (url, params) => {
      const res = await request(url, params);
      return res.json();
    };
  }
});
```

## Customizing the Request SDK

If configuring interceptors alone cannot meet your needs and you want to customize the request function, you can also configure it using `configure`:

```tsx
import nodeFetch from 'node-fetch';

const customFetch = (input: RequestInfo | URL, init: RequestInit) => {
  const curFetch = process.env.MODERN_TARGET !== 'node' ? fetch : nodeFetch as unknown as typeof fetch;
  return curFetch(input, init).then(async res => {
    const data = await res.json();
    data.hello = 'hello custom sdk';
    return data;
  });
};

configure({
  request: customFetch,
});
```

There are some conventions when configuring custom request functions:

- The function's parameters should align with the Fetch API or node-fetch in the browser. All unified invocations of BFF functions will send requests via this function.
- The function's output must be the actual data returned by the API, not a Promise, otherwise, the BFF function will not return data correctly.
- If it's an SSR project, the function must support sending requests on both the browser and server sides.

Below is an example of using axios to customize a request function:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { configure } from '@modern-js/plugin-bff/client';
import type { Method, AxiosRequestHeaders as Headers } from 'axios';

configure({
  async request(...config: Parameters<typeof fetch>) {
    const [url, params] = config;
    const res = await axios({
      url: url as string,  // Here we need to use `as` because fetch and axios types are somewhat incompatible
      method: params?.method as Method,
      data: params?.body,
      headers: params?.headers as Headers,
    });
    return res.data;
  },
});
```
