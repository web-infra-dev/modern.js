# Improve Build Performance

Modern.js optimizes build performance by default, but as the project becomes larger, you may encounter some build performance problems.

This document provides some optional speed-up strategies, developers can choose some of them to improve the build performance.

:::tip 📢 Notice
The strategies in [Bundle Size Optimization](/guides/advanced-features/page-performance/optimize-bundle) can also be used to improve build performance, so we won't repeat them here.
:::

## General optimization strategy

The following are some general optimization strategies, which can speed up the development build and production build, and some of them also optimize the bundle size.

### Using Rspack (recommended)

If you are not using Rspack yet, you can switch to Rspack build mode to improve the build speed by 5~10 times, see [Using Rspack](/guides/advanced-features/rspack-start.html) for more information.

### Upgrade Node.js version

In general, updating Node.js to the latest [LTS release](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule) will help improve build performance.

Especially for devices with Apple M1/M2 chips, it is recommended to use at least Node 18.

Node >= 16 provides Apple Silicon binaries by default, so the performance on M1/M2 models will be greatly improved than Node 14. According to our tests, **After switching from Node 14 to Node >= 16, the compilation speed can be improved by more than 100%**.

You can switch to Node 18 by following steps:

```bash
# Install Node v18
nvm install 18

# switch to Node 18
nvm use 18

# Set Node 18 as the default version
nvm default 18

# View Node version
node -v
```

## Development optimization strategies

The following are strategies for improve build performance in development environment.

### Adjust Source Map format

In order to provide a good debugging experience, Modern.js uses the `cheap-module-source-map` format Source Map by default in the development environment, which is a high-quality Source Map format and will bring certain performance overhead.

You can improve build speed by adjusting the source map format of your development environment.

For example to disable Source Map:

```js
export default {
  tools: {
    bundlerChain(chain, { env }) {
      if (env === 'development') {
        chain.devtool(false);
      }
    },
  },
};
```

Or set the source map format of the development environment to the cheapest `eval` format:

```js
export default {
  tools: {
    bundlerChain(chain, { env }) {
      if (env === 'development') {
        chain.devtool('eval');
      }
    },
  },
};
```

> For detailed differences between different Source Map formats, see [webpack - devtool](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/).

### Adjust Browserslist for development

This strategy is similar to ["Adjust Browserslist"](/guides/advanced-features/page-performance/optimize-bundle#adjust-browserslist), the difference is that we can set different browserslist for development and production environment, thereby reducing the compilation overhead in the development environment.

For example, you can add the following config to `package.json`, which means that only the latest browsers are compatible in the development environment, and the actual browsers are compatible in the production environment:

```json
{
  "browserslist": {
    "production": [">0.2%", "not dead", "not op_mini all"],
    "development": [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version",
      "last 1 safari version"
    ]
  }
}
```

Note that this strategy can lead to some differences in the build result of development production environment.

## Production optimization strategies

The following are strategies for improve build performance in production environment.

### Disable Source Map

If your project does not need Source Map in the production, you can turn it off through the `sourcemap` config to improve the build speed.

```js
export default {
  output: {
    sourceMap: false,
  },
};
```

See [output.sourceMap](/en/configure/app/output/source-map.html) for details.
