# Bundle Size Optimization

Bundle size optimization is an important part of optimizing your production environment because it directly affects the user experience. In this document, we will introduce some common bundle size optimization methods in Modern.js.

## Reduce duplicate dependencies

In real projects, there will be some third-party dependencies installed with multiple versions. Duplicate dependencies can lead to larger bundles and slower builds.

We can detect or eliminate duplicate dependencies with some community tools.

- If you are using `pnpm >= 7.26.0`, you can use the [pnpm dedupe](https://pnpm.io/cli/dedupe) command to upgrade and eliminate duplicate dependencies.

```bash
pnpm dedupe
```

- If you are using `pnpm < 7.26.0`, you can use [pnpm-deduplicate](https://github.com/ocavue/pnpm-deduplicate) to analyze all duplicate dependencies, then update dependencies or declare [pnpm overrides](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides) to merge duplicated dependencies.

```bash
npx pnpm-deduplicate --list
```

- If you are using `yarn`, you can use [yarn-deduplicate](https://github.com/scinos/yarn-deduplicate) to automatically merge duplicated dependencies:

```bash
npx yarn-deduplicate && yarn
```

## Use lightweight libraries

It is recommended to using lightweight libraries in your project, such as replacing [moment](https://momentjs.com/) with [day.js](https://day.js.org/).

If you want to find out the large libraries in the project, you can add the `BUNDLE_ANALYZE=true` environment variable when building:

```bash
BUNDLE_ANALYZE=true pnpm build
```

This will generate a bundle analysis report to help you identify large dependencies.

## Adjust Browserslist

Modern.js will compile the code according to the project's Browserslist config, and inject some Polyfills. If the project does not need to be compatible with legacy browsers, you can adjust the Browserslist and drop some legacy browsers, thereby reducing the compilation overhead on syntax and polyfill.

Modern.js's default [`output.overrideBrowserslist`](/configure/app/output/override-browserslist.html) config is:

```js
['chrome >= 87', 'edge >= 88', 'firefox >= 78', 'safari >= 14'];
```

For example, if you only need to be compatible with browsers above Chrome 100, you can change it to:

```js
['Chrome >= 100'];
```

## Usage polyfill

When it is clear that third-party dependencies do not require additional polyfills, you can set [output.polyfill](/configure/app/output/polyfill.html) to `usage`.

In `usage` mode, Modern.js analyzes the syntax used in the source code and injects the required polyfill code on demand to reduce the size of polyfill.

```js
export default {
  output: {
    polyfill: 'usage',
  },
};
```

## Image Compression

In general front-end projects, the size of image often accounts for a large proportion of the total bundle size of the project.So if the image size can be reduced as much as possible, it will have a significant optimization effect on the project bundle size. You can enable image compression by registering a plugin in Modern.js:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
import { pluginImageCompress } from '@rsbuild/plugin-image-compress';

export default {
  builderPlugins: [pluginImageCompress()],
};
```

See details in [plugin-image-compress](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-plugin-image-compress).

## Split Chunk

A great chunk splitting strategy is very important to improve the loading performance of the application. It can make full use of the browser's caching mechanism to reduce the number of requests and improve the loading speed of the application.

A variety of [chunk splitting strategies](https://rsbuild.rs/guide/optimization/split-chunk) are built into Modern.js, which can meet the needs of most applications. You can also customize the chunk splitting config according to your own business scenarios.
