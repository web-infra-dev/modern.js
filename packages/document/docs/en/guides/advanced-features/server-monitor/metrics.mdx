# Metrics Events

Metric events are distributed by Monitors as events of type `timing` or `counter`.

## Built-in Events

When SSR is enabled, we need to monitor server-side phase durations and have the capability to diagnose server-side issues.

Based on server-side runtime logic, Modern.js provides the following metric events:

| Key                      | Description              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| server-handle-request    | MODERN.js Server request handling duration                          |
| ssr-render-shell         | [SSR] When using Streaming SSR, React renders a shell for early streaming. This marks shell rendering completion time |
| ssr-render-html          | [SSR] Time taken by React to render component tree to HTML (typically under 50ms) |
| server-middleware        | Total execution time of MODERN.js custom server middlewares         |
| server-loader            | Server-side Data Loader total duration                          |
| server-loader-#id        | Individual Data Loader durations on server-side                 |
| server-loader-navigation | Server-side Data Loader duration during client navigation       |

## Built-in Monitor

import InternalMetrics from '@site-docs-en/components/internal-metrics.mdx';

<InternalMetrics />

## Server-Timing

Modern.js injects phase metrics as Server-Timing headers into HTML responses.

Developers can retrieve these metrics using the [Performance API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance) in browsers:

```ts
const navigation = performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0];
const serverTiming = navigation.serverTiming;
console.log(serverTiming);
```
