# Using Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a CSS framework and design system based on Utility Class, which can quickly add common styles to components, and support flexible extension of theme styles.

## Using Tailwind CSS in Modern.js

To use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in Modern.js, you only need to configure it according to the Rsbuild steps. Rsbuild supports Tailwind CSS versions v3 and v4:

- [Tailwind CSS v3](https://v2.rsbuild.rs/guide/styling/tailwindcss-v3#tailwind-css-v3)
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://v2.rsbuild.rs/guide/styling/tailwindcss)

## Tailwind CSS Autocomplete

Tailwind CSS provides an official extension called [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense) for autocompletion of Tailwind CSS class names, CSS functions, and directives in VS Code.

You can follow the steps below to enable the autocomplete feature:

1. Install the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense) extension in VS Code.
2. If the root directory of your project does not have a `tailwind.config.{ts,js}` file, you need to create one and write the Tailwind CSS configuration for your current project. Otherwise, the IDE plugin will not work correctly.

## Browser Compatibility

Tailwind CSS v3 does not support the IE 11 browser, please refer to:

- [Tailwind CSS v3 - Browser Support](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/browser-support).

If you use Tailwind CSS on IE 11 browser, some styles may not be available, please use it with caution.
