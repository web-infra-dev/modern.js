# Using Rsdoctor

Rsdoctor is a Rspack build analysis tool. In Modern.js, we recommend using Rsdoctor to diagnose and analyze the build process and build outputs.

## Install Dependencies

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsdoctor/rspack-plugin -D" />

## Register Plugin

In `modern.config.ts`, you can register the Rspack plugin via `tools.bundlerChain`. Refer to the example below:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
import { RsdoctorRspackPlugin } from '@rsdoctor/rspack-plugin';

export default {
  // ...
  tools: {
    bundlerChain(chain) {
      // Only register the plugin when RSDOCTOR is true, as the plugin will increase build time.
      if (process.env.RSDOCTOR) {
        chain.plugin('rsdoctor').use(RsdoctorRspackPlugin, [
          {
            // Plugin options
          },
        ]);
      }
    },
  },
};
```

## Execute Build

You can execute the build command within your project. After the build is complete, Rsdoctor will automatically open the analysis page for the build.

```bash
RSDOCTOR=true npm run build
```
