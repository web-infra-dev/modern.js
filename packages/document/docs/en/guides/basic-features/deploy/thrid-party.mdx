## Netlify

Netlify is a popular Web development platform designed for building, deploying, and maintaining modern web projects. Deploying on Netlify mainly requires configuring the `netlify.toml` file.

Depending on the complexity of your project, you can configure it incrementally by this doc.

### Pure Front-end Project

Add the `netlify.toml` file to the root directory of the current project:

```bash
.
├── src
├── modern.config.ts
├── netlify.toml
└── package.json
```

Add the following content to `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "modern deploy"
```

:::info
You can refer to the [deployment project example](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern-js-examples/tree/main/examples/modern-js-deploy-csr).

:::

Now, add a project to the Netlify platform and deploy it!

### Full Stack Project

Full-stack projects refer to projects that use Custom Web Server, SSR or BFF. These projects need to be deployed on **Netlify Functions**. Based on the `netlify.toml` file mentioned above, add the following configuration:

```toml title="netlify.toml"
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "modern deploy"

[functions]
  directory = ".netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "none"
  included_files = [".netlify/functions/**"]

```

:::info

1. Currently, Modern.js does not support deployment on Netlify Edge Functions. We will support it in future versions.
2. You can refer to the [deployment project example](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern-js-examples/tree/main/examples/modern-js-deploy-ssr).

:::

### Monorepo

:::info
The following guide is mainly for full-stack projects, for pure CSR projects, just follow [Pure Frontend Project](#pure-front-end-project-1) to deploy.
:::

For Monorepo projects, in addition to building our current project, you also need to build other sub-projects in the repository that the current project depends on.

We take a pnpm Monorepo repository as an example and deploy the Monorepo project on Netlify.

Assuming the directory structure of the Monorepo repository is as follows:

```
.
├── packages
│   ├── app
│   └── app-dep1
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

You need to configure Base directory on the netlify platform as `packages/app`:

<img src="https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/lmeh7nuptpfnuhd/netlify-monorepo-basedir.png?x-resource-account=public" />

Add the following script in `packages/app/package.json`, before executing the deployment command of the `app` repository, first execute the build of other repositories in the workspace:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:packages": "pnpm --filter 'app^...' run build",
    "deploy": "pnpm run build:packages && modern deploy"
  }
}
```

Configure the build command in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run deploy"

[functions]
  directory = ".netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "none"
  included_files = [".netlify/functions/**"]
```

Just submit your code and deploy it using the Netlify platform.

## Vercel

Vercel is a deployment platform for modern web applications that provides a rich set of features to support deploying static websites, server-side rendered applications, and more. To deploy on Vercel, you usually need to configure the `vercel.json` file, which you can configure incrementally depending on the complexity of your project.

### Pure Front-end Project

Add the `vercel.json` file to the root directory of the current project:

```bash
./
├── src
├── modern.config.ts
├── vercel.json
└── package.json
```

Add the following content to `vercel.json`:

```json title="vercel.json"
{
  "buildCommand": "modern deploy",
  "outputDirectory": ".vercel/output"
}
```

Commit your project to git, select Framework Preset as `Other` on the Vercel platform and deploy.

<img src="https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/lmeh7nuptpfnuhd/vercel-framework-preset.png" />

:::info
You can refer to the [deployment project examples](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern-js-examples/tree/main/examples/modern-js-deploy-csr).

:::

### Full Stack Project

Full-stack projects refer to projects that use Custom Web Server, SSR or BFF. These projects need to be deployed on **Vercel Functions**.

In addition to configuring `vercel.json` in the same way as a [pure front-end project](#pure-front-end-project), please note:

1. The Node.js version for function execution is determined by the project configuration on the Vercel platform.

:::info
You can refer to the [deployment project examples](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern-js-examples/tree/main/examples/modern-js-deploy-ssr).

:::

### Monorepo

:::info
The following guide is mainly for full-stack projects, for pure CSR projects, just follow [Pure Frontend Project](#pure-front-end-project-1) to deploy.
:::

For Monorepo projects, in addition to building our current project, you also need to build other sub-projects in the repository that the current project depends on.

We take a pnpm Monorepo repository as an example and deploy the Monorepo project on Vercel.

Assuming the directory structure of the Monorepo repository is as follows:

```
.
├── packages
│   ├── app
│   └── app-dep1
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

First, you need to configure the **Root Directory** as `packages/app` on the Vercel platform:

<img src="https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/lmeh7nuptpfnuhd/vercel-root-directory.png" />

Specify Node.js runtime as `20.x`:

```json title="package.json"
"engines": {
  "node": "20.x"
}
```

Add the following script to `packages/app/package.json` to run `build` command of the other repositories in the workspace before run the `deploy` command for the `app` repository:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:packages": "pnpm --filter 'app^...' run build",
    "deploy": "pnpm run build:packages && modern deploy"
  }
}
```

Add the following content to the `packages/app/vercel.json` file:

```json title="vercel.json"
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run deploy",
  "outputDirectory": ".vercel/output"
}
```

Just submit your code and deploy it using the Vercel platform.

## Tencent EdgeOne

Deploying on Tencent EdgeOne mainly requires configuring the `edgeone.json` file.

### Pure Front-end Project

Add the `edgeone.json` file to the root directory of the current project:

```bash
./
├── src
├── modern.config.ts
├── edgeone.json
└── package.json
```

Add the following content to `edgeone.json`:


```json title="edgeone.json"
{
  "nodeVersion": "22.11.0",
  "buildCommand": "MODERNJS_DEPLOY=edgeone modern deploy",
  "outputDirectory": ".eo-output"
}
```

Now, submit your project to Git, select a repository on the EdgeOne platform, keep the default configuration, and deploy it!

### Full Stack Project

Full-stack projects refer to projects that use Custom Web Server, SSR or BFF.

For full-stack projects, please configure `edgeone.json` as shown in [Pure Front-end Project](#pure-front-end-project-2). Please note: Modern.js does not currently support deployment on EdgeOne Edge Functions; we will add support for this in future versions.

In both BFF and Data Loader, the EventContext of Tencent EdgeOne can be obtained in a manner similar to obtaining Cloudflare Workers Bindings.

## Alibaba Cloud ESA

Deploying on Alibaba Cloud ESA mainly requires configuring the `esa.jsonc` file.

### Pure Front-end Project

Add the `esa.jsonc` file to the root directory of the current project:

```bash
./
├── src
├── modern.config.ts
├── esa.jsonc
└── package.json
```

Add the following content to `esa.jsonc`:

```json title="esa.jsonc"
{
  "buildCommand": "MODERNJS_DEPLOY=aliEsa modern deploy",
  "assets": {
    "directory": "./.ali-esa/dist"
  }
}
```

Now, submit your project to Git, select a repository on the Alibaba Cloud platform, keep the default configuration, and deploy it!

### Full Stack Project

Full-stack projects refer to projects that use Custom Web Server, SSR or BFF.

In addition to configuring `esa.jsonc` as in [Pure Front-end Project](#pure-front-end-project-3), full-stack projects need to **add** an `entry` field:

```json title="esa.jsonc"
{
  "entry": "./.ali-esa/functions/index.js"
  /* Other configurations... */
}
```

## Cloudflare Workers

Deploying on Cloudflare Workers mainly requires configuring the `wrangler.jsonc` file.

### Pure Front-end Project

Add the `wrangler.jsonc` file to the root directory of the current project:

```bash
./
├── src
├── modern.config.ts
├── wrangler.jsonc
└── package.json
```

Add the following content to `wrangler.jsonc`:

```json title="wrangler.jsonc"
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
  "compatibility_date": "2025-10-08",
  "assets": {
    "directory": "./.cf-workers/assets",
    "binding": "ASSETS"
  },
  "build": {
    "command": "MODERNJS_DEPLOY=cfWorkers modern deploy"
  }
}
```

If you are using the local Wrangler CLI for deployment, you also need to configure the `name` field, entering your Cloudflare Workers project name.

Commit your project to Git, select a repository on the Cloudflare Workers platform, keep the default configuration, and deploy it!

### Full Stack Project

Full-stack projects refer to projects that use Custom Web Server, SSR or BFF.

In addition to configuring `wrangler.jsonc` as in [Pure Front-end Project](#pure-front-end-project-4), full-stack projects need to **add** an those fields:


```json title="wrangler.jsonc"
{
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"],
  "main": "./.cf-workers/functions/index.js",
  /* Other configurations... */
}
```

In a BFF, you can use `useHonoContext` to retrieve bindings; in a Data Loader, you can use `context` to retrieve bindings. Please refer to their respective documentation for details.

## GitHub Pages

If you're creating a GitHub Pages for a repository without a custom domain, the page URL will follow this format: `http://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`. Therefore, you need to add the following configuration in `modern.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  server: {
    baseUrl: '/<repository-name>',
  },
  output: {
    assetPrefix: '/<repository-name>',
  },
});
```

GitHub Pages supports two deployment ways: branch deployment or GitHub Actions deployment.

For branch deployment, follow these steps:

1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to Settings > Pages > Source > Deploy from a branch
2. Install the `gh-pages` as devDependency
3. Add the following script to `package.json`

```
"scripts": {
  //...
  "deploy:gh-pages": "MODERNJS_DEPLOY=ghPages modern deploy && gh-pages -d .output"
}
```

4. Run `npm run deploy:gh-pages`

:::info

1. Running `MODERNJS_DEPLOY=ghPages modern deploy` will build the production output for GitHub in the .output directory.
2. You can refer to the [project](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern-js-examples/tree/main/examples/modern-js-deploy-csr)
   :::

For GitHub Actions deployment, select Settings > Pages > Source > GitHub Actions, and add a workflow file to the project. You can refer to the [example](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern-js-examples/tree/main/examples/modern-js-deploy-csr).
