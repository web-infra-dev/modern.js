# Rendering Mode Overview

Modern.js supports multiple rendering modes, and different rendering modes are suitable for different scenarios. Choosing the right rendering mode can significantly improve application performance and user experience.

## Rendering Mode Quick Reference

| Rendering Mode | Characteristics | Use Cases |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **CSR** | Executes JavaScript in the browser to render pages | Applications with strong interactivity and low SEO requirements |
| **SSR** | Pre-renders complete HTML pages on the server | Websites with high requirements for first-screen performance and SEO |
| **Streaming SSR** | Renders and returns progressively, displaying initial UI faster | Applications requiring faster first-screen perception speed (**Default SSR mode**) |
| **RSC** | Components render on the server, reducing client JS size; high cohesion between data and component logic, reducing state passing | Projects pursuing optimal performance and needing to reduce client-side code |
| **SSG** | Generates static pages at build time, can be cached by CDN | Websites with relatively static content, such as blogs and documentation sites |

## Performance Comparison

| Rendering Technology | Core Advantages | Main Bottlenecks |
|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **SSR** | Server-side pre-rendering, beneficial for SEO | Must wait for all data to load before responding |
| **Streaming SSR** | Renders and returns progressively, faster first screen | JS bundle size is still large |
| **Streaming SSR + RSC** | Reduces client JS size | - |

## How to Choose

### Quick Decision Guide

- **Static Content + SEO Required** → **SSG**
- **SEO Required + First Screen Performance** → **Streaming SSR** (default)
- **Pursuing Optimal Performance** → **Streaming SSR + RSC**
- **CSR Project Gradual Optimization** → **CSR + RSC**
- **Highly Interactive + No SEO Needed** → **CSR**

### Combining Modes

Modern.js supports combining multiple rendering modes:

- **Streaming SSR + RSC**: Streaming rendering + reduced client-side code
- **SSG + SSR**: Some pages static, some pages dynamic
- **CSR + RSC**: Client-side rendering + partial Server Components
