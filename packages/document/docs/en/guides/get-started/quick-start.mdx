# Quick Start

## Environment

import Prerequisites from '@site-docs-en/components/prerequisites';

<Prerequisites />

## Installation

Modern.js provides the `@modern-js/create` tool to create projects. It does not require global installation and can be run on-demand using `npx`.

You can create a project in an existing empty directory:

```bash
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
npx @modern-js/create@latest
```

You can also create a project directly in a new directory:

```bash
npx @modern-js/create@latest myapp
```

## Initialize

import InitApp from '@site-docs-en/components/init-app';

<InitApp />

## Development

import DebugApp from '@site-docs-en/components/debug-app';

<DebugApp />

## Configuration

In a Modern.js project created using `@modern-js/create`, a `modern.config.ts` file is generated by default.

You can modify the configuration through this file to override the default behavior of Modern.js. For example, to enable SSR, add the following configuration:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
import { appTools, defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    ssr: true,
  },
  plugins: [appTools()],
});
```

After running `pnpm run dev` again, you can find that the project has completed page rendering on the server in the browser's Network menu.

## Core npm Package

In a newly created project, the `@modern-js/app-tools` npm package is installed by default. It is the core package of the Modern.js framework and provides the following capabilities:

- It offers commonly used CLI commands such as `modern dev`, `modern build`, and more.
- It integrates Rsbuild, providing build capabilities.
- It integrates Modern.js Server, providing capabilities for development and production servers.

`@modern-js/app-tools` is implemented based on the plugin system of Modern.js. Essentially, it is a plugin. Therefore, you need to register `appTools` in the `plugins` field of the configuration file:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
import { appTools, defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [appTools()],
});
```

## Build the project

import BuildOutput from '@site-docs-en/components/build-output';

<BuildOutput />

## Verify

Run `pnpm run serve` in the project to verify whether the build artifacts run normally locally:

```bash
$ pnpm run serve

  Modern.js Framework

info    Starting production server...

  > Local:    http://localhost:8080/
  > Network:  http://192.168.0.1:8080/
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/` in the browser, and the content should be consistent with that of `pnpm run dev`.

## Deployment

import Deploy from '@site-docs-en/components/deploy';
