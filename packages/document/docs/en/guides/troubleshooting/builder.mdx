# Build FAQ

If you encounter any build-related issues, you can refer to the current document for troubleshooting.

---

### Rsbuild FAQ

Modern.js is internally based on [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.rs/) and encapsulates its own build tool, so you can directly refer to the FAQ document of Rsbuild:

- [Rsbuild - Features FAQ](https://rsbuild.rs/guide/faq/features)
- [Rsbuild - Exceptions FAQ](https://rsbuild.rs/guide/faq/exceptions)
- [Rsbuild - HMR FAQ](https://rsbuild.rs/guide/faq/hmr)

### How to view the final generated Rspack configuration?

Modern.js provides [inspect command](https://modernjs.dev/en/apis/app/commands.html) to view the final Modern.js configuration and Rspack configuration generated by the project.

```bash
➜ npx modern inspect

Inspect config succeed, open following files to view the content:

  - Builder Config: /root/my-project/dist/rsbuild.config.mjs
  - Rspack Config (web): /root/my-project/dist/rspack.config.web.mjs
```

### Failed import other modules in Monorepo?

Due to considerations of compilation performance, by default, the Modern.js does not compile files under `node_modules` or files outside the current project directory.

Therefore, when you reference the source code of other sub-projects, you may encounter an error similar to `You may need an additional loader to handle the result of these loaders.`

There are several solutions to this problem:

1. You can enable the source code build mode to compile other sub-projects within the monorepo. Please refer to [Source Code Build Mode](/guides/advanced-features/source-build.html) for more information.
2. You can add the `source.include` configuration option to specify the directories or modules that need to be additionally compiled. Please refer to [Usage of source.include](/configure/app/source/include.html) for more information.
3. You can pre-build the sub-projects that need to be referenced, generate the corresponding build artifacts, and then reference the build artifacts in the current project instead of referencing the source code.

### Find `exports is not defined` runtime error?

If the compilation is succeed, but the `exports is not defined` error appears after opening the page, it is usually because a CommonJS module is compiled by Babel.

Under normal circumstances, Modern.js will not use Babel to compile CommonJS modules. If the [source.include](/en/configure/app/source/include.html) configuration option is used in the project, some CommonJS modules may be added to the Babel compilation.

There are two workarounds for this problem:

1. Avoid adding CommonJS modules to Babel compilation.
2. Set Babel's `sourceType` configuration option to `unambiguous`, for example:

```js
export default {
  tools: {
    babel(config) {
      config.sourceType = 'unambiguous';
    },
  },
};
```

Setting `sourceType` to `unambiguous` may have some other effects, please refer to [Babel official documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options#sourcetype).

---

### Compile error "Error: ES Modules may not assign module.exports or exports.\*, Use ESM export syntax"?

If the following error occurs during compilation, it is usually because a CommonJS module is compiled with Babel in the project, and the solution is same as the above `exports is not defined` problem.

```bash
Error: ES Modules may not assign module.exports or exports.*, Use ESM export syntax, instead: 581
```

For more information, please refer to issue: [babel#12731](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/12731).

### The compilation progress bar is stuck, but there is no Error log in the terminal?

When the compilation progress bar is stuck, but there is no Error log on the terminal, it is usually because an exception occurred during the compilation. In some cases, when Error is caught by the build tool or other modules, the error log can not be output correctly. The most common scenario is that there is an exception in the Babel config, which is caught by the build tool, and the build tool swallows the Error in some cases.

**Solution:**

If this problem occurs after you modify the Babel config, it is recommended to check for the following incorrect usages:

1. You have configured a plugin or preset that does not exist, maybe the name is misspelled, or it is not installed correctly.

```ts
// wrong example
export default {
  tools: {
    babel(config, { addPlugins }) {
      // The plugin has the wrong name or is not installed
      addPlugins('babel-plugin-not-exists');
    },
  },
};
```

2. Whether multiple babel-plugin-imports are configured, but the name of each babel-plugin-import is not declared in the third item of the array.

```ts
// wrong example
export default {
  tools: {
    babel(config, { addPlugins }) {
      addPlugins([
        [
          'babel-plugin-import',
          { libraryName: 'antd', libraryDirectory: 'es' },
        ],
        [
          'babel-plugin-import',
          { libraryName: 'antd-mobile', libraryDirectory: 'es' },
        ],
      ]);
    },
  },
};
```

```ts
// correct example
export default {
  tools: {
    babel(config, { addPlugins }) {
      addPlugins([
        [
          'babel-plugin-import',
          { libraryName: 'antd', libraryDirectory: 'es' },
          'antd',
        ],
        [
          'babel-plugin-import',
          { libraryName: 'antd-mobile', libraryDirectory: 'es' },
          'antd-mobile',
        ],
      ]);
    },
  },
};
```

### Compilation error after referencing a type from lodash

If the `@types/lodash` package is installed in your project, you may import some types from `lodash`, such as the `DebouncedFunc` type:

```ts
import { debounce, DebouncedFunc } from 'lodash';
```

Modern.js will throw an error after compiling the above code:

```bash
Syntax error: /project/src/index.ts: The lodash method `DebouncedFunc` is not a known module.
Please report bugs to https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash/issues.
```

The reason is that Modern.js has enabled the [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) plugin by default to optimize the bundle size of lodash, but Babel cannot distinguish between "value" and "type", which resulting in an exception in the compiled code.

The solution is to use TypeScript's `import type` syntax to explicitly declare the `DebouncedFunc` type:

```ts
import { debounce } from 'lodash';
import type { DebouncedFunc } from 'lodash';
```

:::tip
In any case, it is recommended to use `import type` to import types, this will help the compiler to identify the type.
