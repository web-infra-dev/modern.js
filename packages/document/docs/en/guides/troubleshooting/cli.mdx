### Unable to pass command line arguments correctly when using pnpm?

When using pnpm to call the commands in `package.json`, you need to pay attention to how parameters are passed:

- **If you need to pass parameters to pnpm**, you need to put the parameters before the command.

For example, using the pnpm `--filter` parameter to run the prepare command:

```bash
pnpm run --filter "./packages/**" prepare
```

- **If you need to pass parameters to the command**, you need to put the parameters after the command.

For example, in the following `package.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "command": "modern command"
  }
}
```

The way to pass parameters when running the command is:

```bash
pnpm run command --options
```

:::tip
Modern.js requires Node.js >= 20.19.5, and pnpm v6 does not support Node.js 20, so please use pnpm v7 or higher.
