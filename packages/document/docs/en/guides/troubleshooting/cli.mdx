### Unable to pass command line arguments correctly when using pnpm?

There are some differences between pnpm v6 and pnpm v7+ in how they execute commands, and the following should be noted:

**pnpm v7+ (Recommended)**

pnpm v7 and above have consistent behavior. When using pnpm to call the commands in `package.json`:

- If you need to pass parameters to pnpm, you need to put the parameters before the command.

For example, using the pnpm `--filter` parameter to run the prepare command:

```bash
pnpm run --filter "./packages/**" prepare
```

- If you need to pass parameters to the command, you need to put the parameters after the command.

For example, in the following `package.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "command": "modern command"
  }
}
```

The way to pass parameters when running the command is:

```bash
pnpm run command --options
```

**pnpm v6**

In the following `package.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "command": "modern command"
  }
}
```

If you need to run `modern command --option`:

When using pnpm v6, you need to run `pnpm run command -- --option`.

This is because pnpm v6's handling of command parameters is different from that of Yarn, but similar to that of npm: when the `--` string is not added, the parameters passed are for pnpm; when the `--` string is used, the parameters passed are for running the script.

In the above example, the `--option` parameter is passed to `modern command`. If you run `pnpm run command --option`, the `--option` parameter will be passed to pnpm.

**Summary:**

- **When using pnpm v7+, if passing parameters to pnpm, the parameters need to be placed before the command; if passing parameters to the script, place them directly after the command.**
- **When using pnpm v6, if the parameters are passed to pnpm, `--` is not required; if the parameters are passed to the script, the `--` string needs to be added.**
