- **Build Tool Upgrade**: Default use of [Rspack](https://rspack.dev) for building, no longer supporting Webpack, with build configuration aligned with [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev).
- **React Ecosystem Upgrade**: Full support for [React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19) and [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com).
- **Plugin System Refactoring**: Redesigned plugin API, supporting custom plugins at CLI, Runtime, and Server layers to extend framework capabilities.
- **React Server Component**: Support for using React Server Component in [CSR](/guides/get-started/glossary#csr) and [SSR](/guides/basic-features/render/ssr) projects.
- **Internationalization Enhancement**: Provides out-of-the-box [i18n plugin](/guides/advanced-features/international) to simplify internationalization development workflow.
- **SSG Capability Improvement**: Provides complete [Static Site Generation (SSG)](/guides/basic-features/render/ssg) support.
- **Route Configuration Enhancement**: Supports [config-based routing](/guides/basic-features/routes/config-routes), which can be used alone or combined with [convention-based routing](/guides/basic-features/routes/routes) to provide more flexible route definition.
