# Plugin Migration

### Migration Background

The Modern.js plugin system is constantly evolving. To provide a clearer API and more powerful features, we've optimized the definition and usage of CLI plugins. While the old plugin syntax is still supported for compatibility, we strongly recommend migrating according to this guide to take full advantage of the new plugin system.

### Migration Steps Overview

1.  **Adjust Hook Invocation:** Migrate from the `return hooks` pattern to direct `api.xxx` calls.
2.  **Replace Changed APIs:** Refer to the detailed API mapping table and update your code.

### Detailed Migration Steps

#### Adjust Hook Invocation

The new plugin system recommends using the `api` object to directly call Hooks. This approach is more intuitive and easier to maintain.

```typescript
// Old Syntax (return hooks)
{
  setup: () => ({
    commands({ program }) {
      /*...*/
    },
  });
}

// New Syntax (api.xxx)
{
  setup: api => {
    api.addCommand(({ program }) => {
      /*...*/
    });
  };
}
```

**Explanation:** The `api` object provides all available Hooks and utility methods.

#### Replace Changed APIs

To maintain API consistency and clarity, we've adjusted the names of some APIs. The following table lists all changed APIs and their old and new counterparts:

| Old API                    | New API                       | Description                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useAppContext`            | `getAppContext`               | Gets the application context information.                                                                                   |
| `useConfigContext`         | `getConfig`                   | Gets the configuration defined in the user's configuration file.                                                            |

| `beforeConfig`             | (Defined directly in `setup`) | The `beforeConfig` Hook is no longer needed. Write related logic directly in the `setup` function.                          |
| `prepare`                  | `onPrepare`                   | The preparation stage before running the main process.                                                                      |
| `afterPrepare`             | `onAfterPrepare` (Deprecated) | Executes after `onPrepare`, but may be deprecated in future versions. It's recommended to merge the logic into `onPrepare`. |
