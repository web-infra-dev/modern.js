# lambda/*.[tj]s

Files that declare API routes under the [BFF Framework Mode](/guides/advanced-features/bff/type.html#framework-mode). Except for [convention files](/apis/app/hooks/api/api#allow-list), files under the `lambda/` directory will be registered as the routes.

:::info
Using the `api` directory requires enabling the BFF function, and you need to run the new command to enable the "BFF" function under the project.

:::

:::tip
This file supports using `js` or `ts` language, but must export functions using `esm` syntax.

## Routing File Convention

### Default Routing

The routing system will map files named `index` to the previous directory.

- `api/lambda/index.ts` -> `$BASENAME/`
- `api/lambda/user/index.ts` -> `$BASENAME/user`

### Nested Routing

The routing system also supports parsing nested files. If you create a nested folder structure, the files will still automatically resolve routes in the same way.

- `api/lambda/hello.ts` -> `$BASENAME/hello`
- `api/lambda/user/list.ts` -> `$BASENAME/user/list`

### Dynamic Routing

The routing system supports generating dynamic routes through file directories named with `[]`.

- `api/lambda/user/[username]/info.ts` -> `$BASENAME/user/:username/info`
- `api/lambda/user/[username]/delete.ts` -> `$BASENAME/user/:username/delete`
- `api/lambda/article/[id]/info.ts` -> `$BASENAME/article/:id/info`

The `$BASENAME` can be configured in `modern.config.js`, and the default value is `/api`.

### Allow List

By default, all files under the `lambda` directory are parsed as BFF function files, but we also set up a whitelist so that these files are not parsed:

- Files named starting with `_`. For example: `_utils.ts`.
- All files under a folder named starting with `_`. For example: `_utils/index.ts`, `_utils/cp.ts`.
- Test files. For example: `foo.test.ts`.
- TypeScript type files. For example: `hello.d.ts`.
- Files under `node_module`.

## Function Definition

Completely consistent with the [Function Definition](/apis/app/hooks/api/api#function-definition) under the function mode.
