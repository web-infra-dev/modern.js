# public/

Any static assets can be placed in the `public/` directory, and the files will be deployed to the corresponding application domain by the server.

## Description

The file routing is based on the convention of the directory structure, where `public/` is the root directory corresponding to the root path of the Web application.

For example, the `config/public/sdk/index.js` file will be deployed under `${domain}/sdk/index.js` after deployment.

## Scenarios

For example, authentication files required by third-party systems such as `robots.txt` and `auth.xml`.

Or SDKs for other business parties (requiring unchanged routing), or HTML files without entry.

:::info
For static assets (such as SVG images) that need to be imported through import in the source code, it is recommended to manage them in the `src/assets` directory.

## Code Compression

If the file in the directory is a `.js` file, it will be automatically compressed during production environment construction.

If the file ends with `.min.js`, it will not be compressed.
