# storybook/

Modern.js supports debugging using Storybook. When configuring Storybook, you need to configure it in the `config/storybook` directory of the project.

Please refer to [Storybook Configuration](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview) for Storybook configuration.

:::info
Enabling the Visual Testing (Storybook) mode function requires running the new command to enable it under the project first.

:::

#### Example

For the webpack configuration of the Storybook Manager app section, you can configure it by adding the `./config/storybook/main.js` file to configure it.

```js
// ./config/storybook/main.js

module.exports = {
  // it controls the Storybook manager app
  managerWebpack: async (config, options) => {
    // update config here
    return config;
  },
};
```

### Limitation

There are some limitations when using the `config/storybook` directory for configuration:

- The location where the Story file is stored cannot be modified, that is, the `stories` configuration cannot be modified in the `main.js` file.
- It is not supported to modify Webpack and Babel related configurations in `main.js`, related requirements can be passed through [`tools.webpack`](/configure/app/tools/webpack.html) /[`tools.babel`](/configure/app/tools/babel.html) modify.
