# upload/

Any static assets can be placed in the `upload/` directory.

## Description

In the development environment, the static assets in this directory will be hosted under the `/upload` path. After building the application, the files in this directory will be copied to the dist directory.

This file convention is mainly used for developers to use plugins to proactively upload static assets to the CDN.

## Scenarios

For example, SDKs for project use only, such as `google-analysis.js` (usually requires HTTP caching).

Pictures, font files, common CSS, etc.

## Code Compression

If the file in the directory is a `.js` file, it will be automatically compressed during production environment construction.

If the file ends with `.min.js`, it will not be compressed.

## More Usage

In React components, you can add this prefix through [Environment Variables](/guides/basic-features/env-vars.html#asset_prefix):

```tsx
export default () => {
  return (
    <img src={`${process.env.ASSET_PREFIX}/upload/banner.png`}></img>
  );
};
```

In addition, whether it is in [Custom HTML](/guides/basic-features/html) or any HTML file under [`config/public/`](/apis/app/hooks/config/public), you can directly use HTML tags to reference resources in the `config/upload/` directory:

```html
<script src="/upload/index.js"></script>
```

If you set the [`dev.assetPrefix`](/configure/app/dev/asset-prefix) or [`output.assetPrefix`](/configure/app/output/asset-prefix) prefix, you can also use template syntax to add the prefix directly:

```html
<script src="<%=assetPrefix %>/upload/index.js"></script>
```

:::info
Modern.js does not support using files under `config/upload/` through URLs in `config/public/*.css` (such as background-image).
