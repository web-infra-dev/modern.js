# **/*.test.[tj]sx?

Application project test files.

The application project supports creating files with the suffix `.test.[tj]sx?` in the project source code directory (`src`) to write test cases.

:::info
To use unit testing and integration testing, you need to enable the "Unit Testing / Integration Testing" feature by running the `new` command in the project first.
