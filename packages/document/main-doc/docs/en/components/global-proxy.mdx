Modern.js provides an out-of-the-box global proxy plugin `@modern-js/plugin-proxy`, which is based on [whistle](https://github.com/avwo/whistle) and can be used to view and modify the requests and responses of HTTP/HTTPS, as well as be used as an HTTP proxy server.

### Setting Proxy Rules

After installing the proxy plugin and filling in the rules, execute `pnpm run dev`. Modern.js will automatically enable the proxy server after the development server starts.

Specific proxy rules can be set via the [`dev.proxy`](/configure/app/dev/proxy) or the `config/proxy.js` file.

### Proxy Dashboard

After installing the proxy plugin and configuring the proxy rules, execute the `pnpm run dev` command:

```bash
  App running at:

  Local:    http://localhost:8080/
  Network:  http://192.168.0.1:8080/

ℹ  info      Starting the proxy server.....
✔  success   Proxy Server start on localhost:8899
```

You can see that the proxy server has started successfully in the console.

Access `http://localhost:8899`, and you can set the rules through the dashboard.
