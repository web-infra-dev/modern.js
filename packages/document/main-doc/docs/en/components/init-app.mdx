Modern.js generator will provide an interactive Q & A interface, initialization items according to the result, according to the default selection:

```bash
? Please select the type of project you want to create: Web App
? Please select the programming language: TS
? Please select the package manager: pnpm
```

After create the project, Modern.js automatically installs dependency and creates a git repository.

```bash
[INFO] dependencies are automatically installed
[INFO] git repository has been automatically created
[INFO] Success！
You can run the following command in the directory of the new project:
pnpm run dev          # Starting the dev server
pnpm run build        # Build the app for production
pnpm run serve        # Preview the production build locally
pnpm run lint         # Run ESLint and automatically fix problems
pnpm run new          # Enable optional features or add a new entry
```

:::note
In addition to working during project initialization, the Modern.js generator can also generate modules of the project in subsequent development, which is not thrown away as soon as it is used.
