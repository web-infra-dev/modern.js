`@modern-js/create` provides an interactive Q & A interface to initialize the project based on the results, with initialization performed according to the default settings:

```bash
? Please select the programming language: TS
? Please select the package manager: pnpm
```

After create the project, Modern.js will automatically install dependencies and create a git repository.

```bash
[INFO] dependencies are automatically installed
[INFO] git repository has been automatically created
[INFO] Success！
You can run the following command in the directory of the new project:
pnpm run dev          # Starting dev server
pnpm run build        # Build the app for production
pnpm run serve        # Preview the production build locally
pnpm run lint         # Run ESLint and automatically fix problems
pnpm run new          # Enable optional features or add a new entry
```

Now, the project structure is as follows:

```
.
├── src
│   ├── modern-app-env.d.ts
│   └── routes
│       ├── index.css
│       ├── layout.tsx
