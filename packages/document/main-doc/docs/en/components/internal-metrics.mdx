In Modern.js, metric events are also handled by `LoggerMonitor`, which outputs metrics to the console in a specific format.

:::info
The built-in `LoggerMonitor` depends on the [rslog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rslog) library.
:::

The `rslog` instance initialized in Modern.js outputs logs at `debug` level and above in development environment by default, and outputs all logs in production environment. In the built-in `LoggerMonitor`, all metric events are output as Debug logs. Therefore, if you want to view metric event information in the development environment, you need to add additional environment variables.

Developers can add the environment variable `DEBUG=true` when running the `dev` command. If running normally, after accessing, you can see the following output in the console:

```shell
> Local:    http://localhost:8080/
> press h + enter to show shortcuts

debug   SSR Debug - server-loader, cost: 2.000094, req.url = /
debug   SSR Debug - ssr-prerender, cost: 6.99997, req.url = /
debug   SSR Debug - ssr-render-html, cost: 0.999927, req.url = /
debug   Debug - server-handle-request, cost: 19.999981, req.url = /
debug     --> GET / 200 90ms
```
