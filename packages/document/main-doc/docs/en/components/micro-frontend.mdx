Micro-frontend (MFE) is an architecture style similar to microservices. It is a composition of multiple independently delivered frontend applications, forming a cohesive whole. MFE decomposes frontend applications into smaller, simpler applications that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently while still appearing as a cohesive single product to users.

It primarily addresses two problems:

- Difficulty in maintaining large and complex applications as they evolve over time.
- Inefficiency caused by cross-team or cross-department collaboration in project development.
