Module Federation (MF) is a feature of Webpack. It allows a JavaScript application to dynamically load code from another application, and in the process, share dependencies. If an application consuming a federated module does not have a dependency needed by the federated code, Webpack will download the missing dependency from that federated build origin.

This allows for the creation of micro-frontend-style applications, where multiple systems can share code and be dynamically updated without having to rebuild the entire application.

Modern.js provides an example project for Module Federation. Please refer to [module-federation-examples - modernjs](https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples/tree/db5bdbeee56f779999a2c591fc553eb94eb20b36/modernjs).
