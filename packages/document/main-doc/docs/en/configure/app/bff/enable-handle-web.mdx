# bff.enableHandleWeb

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

:::caution
First you need to enable the "BFF" function using [new](/apis/app/commands#modern-new) command.
:::

By default, the BFF service can only handle requests from the BFF API.

When this value is set to `true`, page request traffic also goes through the BFF, and the logic built into Modern.js for page rendering defaults to running as the last middleware for the BFF service.

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  bff: {
    enableHandleWeb: true,
  },
});
```
