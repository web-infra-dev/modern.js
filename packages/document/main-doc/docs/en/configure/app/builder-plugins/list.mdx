# Plugin List

## Using Plugins

You can register Rsbuild plugins in the `modern.config.ts` file using the `builderPlugins` option. For more details, refer to [Using plugins on npm](/configure/app/builder-plugins/index.html#using-plugins-on-npm).

## Official Plugins

:::tip
Most plugins in Rsbuild have been built into Modern.js. For example, when you need to inject polyfills of Node core modules in the browser side, you can directly use the [output.disableNodePolyfill](/configure/app/output/disable-node-polyfill.html) configuration.
:::

Only the official Rsbuild plugins that are not built into Modern.js are listed below:

- [Image Compress Plugin](https://rsbuild.dev/plugins/list/plugin-image-compress): Compress the image resources used in the project.
- [Stylus Plugin](https://rsbuild.dev/plugins/list/plugin-stylus): Use Stylus as the CSS preprocessor.
- [UMD Plugin](https://rsbuild.dev/plugins/list/plugin-umd): Used to build outputs in UMD format.
