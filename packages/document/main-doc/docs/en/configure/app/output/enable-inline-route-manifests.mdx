# output.disableInlineRouteManifests

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

When using convention-based routing, the framework injects routing information into the client for optimization purposes. By default, routing information is injected into the html, but when this is configured to `true`, routing information is injected into a separate JS file.

Example:

```ts
export default {
  output: {
    disableInlineRouteManifests: true,
  },
};
```
