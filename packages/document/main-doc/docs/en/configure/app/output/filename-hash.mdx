# output.filenameHash

- **Type:** `boolean | string`
- **Default:** `true`

Whether to add a hash value to the filename after the production build.

### Example

By default, the filename of the output files will include a hash value:

```bash
dist/static/css/index.7879e19d.css
dist/static/js/index.18a568e5.js
```

You can set `output.filenameHash` to false to disable this behavior:

```js
export default {
  output: {
    filenameHash: false,
  },
};
```

After rebuilding, the output filenames becomes:

```bash
dist/static/css/index.css
dist/static/js/index.js
```

For detailed usage, please refer to [Rsbuild - output.filenameHash](https://rsbuild.dev/config/output/filename-hash).
