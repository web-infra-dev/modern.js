# performance.bundleAnalyze

- **Type:** `Object | undefined`

Used to enable the [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer) plugin to analyze the size of the output.

By default, Modern.js does not enable `webpack-bundle-analyzer`. When this feature is enabled, the default configuration is as follows:

```js
const defaultConfig = {
  analyzerMode: 'static',
  openAnalyzer: false,
  // Distinguish by target names, such as `web`, `node`, etc.
  reportFilename: `report-${target}.html`,
};
```
