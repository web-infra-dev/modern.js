# runtime.router

- **Type:** `boolean | Object`
- **Default:** `false`

When enabled, the router option provides routing management for Modern.js conventional routes. It is based on [React Router 6](https://reactrouter.com/).

## basename

- **Type:** `string`
- **Default:** ``

The basename option specifies the subpath where the app is deployed, for situations where it cannot be deployed to the root domain.

## supportHtml5History

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`

If the value of `supportHtml5History` is `true`, `BrowserRouter` would be used, otherwise `HashRouter` would be used. `BrowserRouter` is recommended.

:::warning
When SSR is enabled, `supportHtml5History` is not supported.
