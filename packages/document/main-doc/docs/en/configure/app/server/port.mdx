# server.port

- **Type:** `number`
- **Default:** `8080`

When running the `dev`, `start`, and `serve` commands, Modern.js will start with `8080` as the default port and automatically increase the port number when the port is occupied. You can use this configuration to modify the port number that the Server starts with:

```js title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 3000,
  },
});
```

### Difference between `server.port` and `dev.port`

In most cases, we recommend using `server.port` instead of `dev.port` to set the port number, and the differences between them are as follows:

- `dev.port` only works in the development environment, while `server.port` works in both the development and production environments.
- In the development environment, `dev.port` has a higher priority than `server.port`.

When you set both `dev.port` and `server.port`, `dev.port` will take effect in the development environment, and `server.port` will take effect in the production environment. For example, in the following example, the port number listened to in the development environment is `3001`, and the port number listened to in the production environment is `3002`.

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  dev: {
    port: 3001,
  },
  server: {
    port: 3002,
  },
});
```
