# server.routes

- **Type:** `Object`
- **Default:** Server-side routing rules generated based on file conventions, with one route rule generated for each entry, and the entry name is equal to the route path.

This configuration option only applies to server-side routing and can customize the access route of application entries.

## Custom access routes

The `key` of the object is the name of the current application entry, and the value can be a `string | Array<string>`.

When the value type is `string`, the current value represents the route path for accessing the entry.

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    routes: {
      // Default route is /entryName1, customized to /p/test1
      entryName1: '/p/test1'
      // Supports dynamic server-side routing configuration
      entryName2: '/detail/:id'
    }
  }
});
```

Multiple access routes can also be set for the entry through `Array<string>`:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    routes: {
      'page-a': [`/a`, '/b'],
    },
  },
});
```

At this time, the `page-a` entry can be accessed through both the `/a` and `/b` routes.

After executing the `dev` command, you can view two route records for the `page-a` entry in `dist/route.json`:

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "urlPath": "/a",
      "entryName": "page-a",
      "entryPath": "html/page-a/index.html",
      "isSPA": true,
      "isSSR": false
    },
    {
      "urlPath": "/b",
      "entryName": "page-a",
      "entryPath": "html/page-a/index.html",
      "isSPA": true,
      "isSSR": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Custom response headers

Response headers can be set by configuring the `resHeaders` of the entry:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    routes: {
      'page-a': {
        route: ['/a', '/b'],
        resHeaders: {
          'x-modern-test': '1',
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

:::note
This configuration takes effect in both the production and development environments, and different response headers can be set according to the NODE_ENV to distinguish between environments. However, if you only need to set response headers in the development environment, it is recommended to use `tools.devServer.headers`.
