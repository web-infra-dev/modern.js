# source.disableDefaultEntries

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

Used to disable the function of automatically identifying the page entry according to the project directory structure.

:::info
By default, Modern.js will get the page entries according to the project directory structure. For details, please refer to [Entry](/guides/concept/entries).
:::

Set the following to disable the default behavior:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  source: {
    disableDefaultEntries: true,
  },
});
```

After turning off the default behavior, you need to use [`source.entries`](/configure/app/source/entries) to configure custom entries.

:::warning
We recommend using the directory convention provided by Modern.js to organize the code, so as to better use the functions of the framework and avoid some redundant configurations.
