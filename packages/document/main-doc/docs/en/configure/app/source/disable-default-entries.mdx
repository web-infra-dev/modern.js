# source.disableDefaultEntries

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`

Used to disable the functionality of automatically identifying page entry points based on directory structure.

:::info
By default, Modern.js automatically determines the entry points of pages based on directory conventions, as described in [Entries](/guides/concept/entries).

:::

To disable this default behavior, set the following:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  source: {
    disableDefaultEntries: true,
  },
});
```

After disabling the default behavior, you will need to use the [`source.entries`](/configure/app/source/entries) configuration to define custom entry points.

:::warning
We recommend organizing your code using the directory conventions provided by Modern.js to make better use of the framework's functionality and to avoid some redundant configurations.
