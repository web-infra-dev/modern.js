# transformer

- **Type:** `'babel-jest' | 'ts-jest'`
- **Default:** `babel-jest`

First need to run `new` command to enable [Unit Test / Integration Test] features.

Configure the compilation tool used during test execution. By default, `babel-jest` is used. You can configure it to use either [babel-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-jest) or [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest).

:::info Additional
`babel-jest` can compile TypeScript files but does not perform type checking. If you want to perform type checking on your TypeScript files while running test cases, you can use `ts-jest`.
