# BFF

BFF (Backends for Frontends) is an architectural pattern primarily used to address issues of data aggregation in front-end and back-end collaboration. Under the BFF architecture, front-end applications do not communicate directly with backend services. Instead, they interact with backend services through a dedicated BFF middleware layer, custom-made for the front end.

The main problems it to solve include:

- Aggregation, mapping, clipping, and proxying of lower-level APIs according to their own business needs.
- Cache data for some specific scenarios to improve performance and thus improve user experience.
- Quickly development of new products based on existing interfaces.
- Interface with third-party systems, such as login authentication.

Modern.js officially supported the BFF and provided the **Integrated BFF** to further strengthen the BFF's capabilities, mainly including the following capabilities:

- Quick development and debugging go live, running, building, and deploying BFF code in the same project.
- Minimal pure function call, directly import BFF function on the front end, and can be automatically converted into HTTP request when called.
- No private protocol, follow RESTful API specification, all BFF interfaces are standardized.
- Full TypeScript support.
- Meet user preferences and support multi-frame extension writing.
