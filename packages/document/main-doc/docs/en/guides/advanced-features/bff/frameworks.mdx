# Runtime Framework

Modern.js uses [Hono.js](https://hono.dev/) as the BFF and Server runtime framework, so you can [extend BFF Server](/guides/advanced-features/bff/extend-server.html) based on the Hono.js ecosystem.

## Getting Request Context

Sometimes in BFF functions, it's necessary to obtain the request context to handle more logic. In such cases, you can use `useHonoContext` to get it:

```ts title="api/lambda/hello.ts"
import { useHonoContext } from '@modern-js/plugin-bff/hono'
export const get = async () => {
  const c = useHonoContext();
  console.info(`access url: ${c.req.url}`);
  return 'Hello Modern.js'
};
```
