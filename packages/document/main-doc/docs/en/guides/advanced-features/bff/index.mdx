# BFF

In the development of the concept of **front back separation**, the front-end part can do more and more things, and the front-end needs some UI-oriented data interfaces, so the industry introduced the concept of BFF (Backends for Frontends).

The main problems it to solve include:

- Aggregation, mapping, clipping, and proxying of lower-level APIs according to their own business needs.
- Cache data for some specific scenarios to improve performance and thus improve user experience.
- Quickly development of new products based on existing interfaces.
- Interface with third-party systems, such as login authentication.

Modern.js officially supported the BFF and provided the **Integrated BFF** to further strengthen the BFF's capabilities, mainly including the following capabilities:

- Quick development and debugging go live, running, building, and deploying BFF code in the same project.
- Minimal pure function call, directly import BFF function on the front end, and can be automatically converted into HTTP request when called.
- No private protocol, follow RESTful API specification, all BFF interfaces are standardized.
- Full TypeScript support.
- Meet user preferences and support multi-frame extension writing.
