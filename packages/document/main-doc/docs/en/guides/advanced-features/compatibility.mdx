# Browser Compatibility

## Browserslist Configuration

Modern.js supports three ways to set the range of browsers that a web application needs to support.

### Method 1: Configure via `.browserslistrc` File

Modern.js supports setting the range of browsers that a web application needs to support. You can set the [Browserslist](https://browsersl.ist/) values in the `.browserslistrc` file.

When you create a new Modern.js project, a default `.browserslistrc` configuration is included, which indicates that JavaScript code will be compiled to ES6 format.

```yaml title=".browserslistrc"
chrome >= 51
edge >= 15
firefox >= 54
safari >= 10
ios_saf >= 10
```

When the `overrideBrowserslist` configuration is not specified in the project, this `.browserslistrc` file will take effect.

### Method 2: Configure via package.json

You can also configure browserslist by setting the `browserslist` field in the `package.json` file:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "browserslist": [
    "chrome >= 51"
    // Other browser configurations...
  ]
}
```

### Method 3: Configure via `output.overrideBrowserslist`

You can also configure browserslist by setting the [`output.overrideBrowserslist`](/configure/app/output/override-browserslist) field in the `modern.config.js` file:

```js title="modern.config.js"
export default {
  output: {
    overrideBrowserslist: [
      'chrome >= 51',
      // Other browser configurations...
    ],
  },
};
```

### Configuration Priority

The `overrideBrowserslist` configuration has a higher priority than the `.browserslistrc` file and the `browserslist` field in package.json.

In most scenarios, it is recommended to prioritize using the `.browserslistrc` file rather than the `overrideBrowserslist` configuration because the `.browserslistrc` file is the officially defined configuration file, has better general applicability, and can be recognized by other libraries in the community.

## Polyfill

### Compile-time Polyfill

Modern.js by default injects corresponding polyfill code at compile time through [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js).

By default, it will include the necessary polyfill code based on the project's Browserslist settings, so you generally do not need to worry about polyfill issues for your project source code and third-party dependencies. However, since some unused polyfill code is included, the final bundle size may increase.

:::info
For scenarios where certain third-party dependencies clearly do not require polyfills, you can set [`output.polyfill`](/configure/app/output/polyfill) to `usage`. This way, Babel will only inject polyfill code based on the syntax used in the code during compilation.
