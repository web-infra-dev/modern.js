# Browser Compatibility

## Browserslist Configuration

Modern.js supports setting the browserslist for your web applications. You can set the value of [Browserslist](https://browsersl.ist/) in the `.browserslistrc` file.

When you create a new Modern.js project, it will includes a `.browserslistrc` configuration by default, which means that the JavaScript code will be compiled to ES6.

```yaml title=".browserslistrc"
chrome >= 51
edge >= 15
firefox >= 54
safari >= 10
ios_saf >= 10
```

:::tip
Please refer to [Rsbuild - Browserslist](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/advanced/browserslist) for more information.

## Polyfill

### Polyfill At Compile

Modern.js defaults to importing corresponding polyfill code from [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) during compilation.

By default, the required Polyfill code will be introduced according to the settings of the Browserslist, so there is no need to worry about the Polyfill problem of the project source code and third-party dependencies, but because it contains some Polyfill code that is not used, the final bundle size may be increased.

:::info
For case where Polyfill is not required for third-party dependencies, you can set ['output.polyfill'](/configure/app/output/polyfill) to `usage`, so that Babel compiles only Polyfill code based on the syntax used in the code.
