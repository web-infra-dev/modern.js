# Using Rsbuild Plugin

## Introduce Rsbuild Plugin

Rsbuild is the build tool of Modern.js. You can modify the default build behavior and add various additional features by adding the Rsbuild plugin, including but not limited to:

- Modifying Rspack configurations
- Processing new file types
- Modifying or compiling files
- Deploying artifacts

You can register the Rsbuild plugin through the `builderPlugins` option in `modern.config.ts`, see [builderPlugins](/configure/app/builder-plugins) for details.

## Official Plugins

:::tip
Most plugins in Rsbuild have been built into Modern.js. For example, when you need to inject the Polyfill of the Node module, you can directly use the [output.disableNodePolyfill](/configure/app/output/disable-node-polyfill.html) configuration.
:::

Only the official Rsbuild plugins that are not built into Modern.js are listed below:

- [Image Compress Plugin](https://rsbuild.dev/plugins/list/plugin-image-compress): Compress the image resources used in the project.
- [Stylus Plugin](https://rsbuild.dev/plugins/list/plugin-stylus): Use Stylus as the CSS preprocessor.
- [UMD Plugin](https://rsbuild.dev/plugins/list/plugin-umd): Used to build outputs in UMD format.
