# Using Rspack

import Rspack from '@modern-js/builder-doc/docs/en/shared/rspack.md';

<Rspack />

**Modern.js provides out-of-the-box Rspack support**, so you can switch between the stable Webpack and the faster Rspack.

This document will show you how to enable Rspack build mode in Modern.js.

## Initializing an Rspack project

The Modern.js generator provides an interactive question-and-answer interface to initialize a project. To create an Rspack project, simply select the **Rspack** build tool by running:

import InitRspackApp from '@site-docs-en/components/init-rspack-app';

<InitRspackApp />

After the project is created, you can experience the project by running `pnpm run dev`. For more project information, please refer to [Quick Start](/guides/get-started/quick-start.html).

:::tip
When using Rspack as the bundler, the following Features are temporarily unavailable as some of the capabilities are still under development and we will provide support in the future.

- Micro Frontend
- Storybook Devtool
- Server Side Rendering + Conventional Routing
- Static Site Generation + Conventional Routing

## Migrating from webpack to Rspack

You can enable Rspack build by running `pnpm run new`:

```bash
$ pnpm run new
? Action: Enable features
? Enable features: Enable Rspack Build
```

After executing the command, enable the Rspack build in `modern.config.ts`:

```diff title=modern.config.ts
import appTools, { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';

+ export default defineConfig<'rspack'>({
  plugins: [
    appTools({
+     bundler: 'experimental-rspack',
    }),
  ],
});
```

:::tip
When migrating from webpack to Rspack, there may have some differences in build and configuration capabilities. For more details, please refer to [Configuration Differences](https://modernjs.dev/builder/en/guide/advanced/rspack-start.html#migrating-from-webpack-to-rspack).
