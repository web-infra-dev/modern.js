# Using Rspack

import Rspack from '@modern-js/builder-doc/docs/en/shared/rspackTip.mdx';

<Rspack />

**Modern.js provides out-of-the-box Rspack support**, so you can switch between the stable Webpack and the faster Rspack.

This document will show you how to enable Rspack build mode in Modern.js.

## Initializing an Rspack project

The Modern.js generator provides an interactive question-and-answer interface to initialize a project. To create an Rspack project, simply select the **Rspack** build tool by running:

import InitRspackApp from '@site-docs-en/components/init-rspack-app';

<InitRspackApp />

After the project is created, you can experience the project by running `pnpm run dev`. For more project information, please refer to [Quick Start](/guides/get-started/quick-start.html).

:::tip
When using Rspack as the bundler, the following Features are temporarily unavailable as some of the capabilities are still under development and we will provide support in the future.

- Storybook Devtool
- The usage of [useLoader](/guides/basic-features/data-fetch.html) in Client Side Rendering

## Enable Rspack build

You can enable Rspack build by running `pnpm run new`:

```bash
$ pnpm run new
? Please select the operation you want: Enable features
? Please select the feature name: Enable Rspack Build
```

After executing the command, enable the Rspack build in `modern.config.ts`:

```diff title=modern.config.ts
import { appTools, defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';

+ export default defineConfig<'rspack'>({
  plugins: [
    appTools({
+     bundler: 'experimental-rspack',
    }),
  ],
});
```

import RspackPrecautions from '@modern-js/builder-doc/docs/en/shared/rspackPrecautions.md';

<RspackPrecautions />

## Migrating configuration

After enabling Rspack building capability, further configuration migration is needed by referring to the [Configuration Differences](https://modernjs.dev/builder/en/guide/advanced/rspack-start.html#migrating-from-webpack-to-rspack).

## The relationship between Rspack and Modern.js versions

Usually, the latest version of Rspack will be integrated into Modern.js. You can update the Modern.js-related dependencies and built-in Rspack to the latest version by using `npx modern upgrade` in your project.

However, Modern.js uses a locked version dependency method (non-automatic upgrade) for Rspack. Due to differences in release cycles, the version of Rspack integrated into Modern.js may be behind the latest version of Rspack.

When Rspack is enabled for building through dev / build, the current version of Rspack used in the framework will be printed automatically:

![rspack_version_log](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/6221eh7uhbfvhn/modern/img_v2_dfcf051f-21db-4741-a108-d9f7a82c3abg.png)

### Override the Built-in Rspack Version

You can override Rspack to a specific version using the capbilities provided by package managers such as pnpm, yarn, npm.

For example, if you are using pnpm, you can update the Rspack version with `overrides` as shown below:

```json title=package.json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "@rspack/core": "nightly",
      "@rspack/dev-client": "nightly",
      "@rspack/plugin-html": "nightly"
    }
  }
}
```

:::tip What is Rspack Nightly Version
The Rspack nightly build fully replicates the full release build for catching errors early.
Usually it is available and any errors that arise will fixed promptly.
However, if there are any break changes that require modern.js to modify the code, we recommend to wait for the next version of modern.js.
