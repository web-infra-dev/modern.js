# Logs Events

Log events are distributed by Modern.js as events of type `log`.

## Built-in Events

Based on server-side runtime logic, Modern.js provides the following log events:

| Stage          | Message                                       | Level |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| RENDER_HTML    | App Render To HTML                            | error |
| RENDER_STREAM  | An error occurs during streaming SSR          | error |
| RENDER_SHELL   | An error occurs during streaming render shell | error |
| RENDER_DEGRADE | SSR Fallback Triggered                        | debug |

Modern.js also retains SSR logs from legacy versions using `useLoader`:

| Stage      | Message           | Level |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| PRERENDER  | App Prerender     | error |
| USE_LOADER | App run useLoader | error |

:::tip
The `useLoader` API is now deprecated. We recommend migrating to convention-based routing and using Data Loaders for data fetching. Applications already using Data Loaders can enable [`ssr.disablePrerender`](/configure/app/server/ssr.html#object-type) to disable prerendering and improve SSR performance.
