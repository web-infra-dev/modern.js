# Logs Events

Log events are distributed by Modern.js as events of type `log`.

## Built-in Events

Based on server-side runtime logic, Modern.js provides the following log events:

| Stage           | Message                                      | Level |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| RENDER_HTML     | App Render To HTML                           | error |
| RENDER_STREAM   | An error occurs during streaming SSR         | error |
| RENDER_SHELL    | An error occurs during streaming render shell | error |

Modern.js also retains SSR logs from legacy versions using `useLoader`:

| Stage         | Message                         | Level |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ----- |
| PRERENDER     | App Prerender                   | error |
| USE_LOADER    | App run useLoader               | error |

:::tip
The `useLoader` API is now deprecated. We recommend migrating to convention-based routing and using Data Loaders for data fetching. Applications already using Data Loaders can enable [`ssr.disablePrerender`](/configure/app/server/ssr.html#object-type) to disable prerendering and improve SSR performance.
