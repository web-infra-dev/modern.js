# Logs Events

Log events are distributed by Modern.js as events of type `log`.

## Built-in Events

Based on server-side runtime logic, Modern.js provides the following log events:

| Stage           | Message                                      | Level |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| RENDER_HTML     | App Render To HTML                           | error |
| RENDER_STREAM   | An error occurs during streaming SSR         | error |
| RENDER_SHELL    | An error occurs during streaming render shell | error |

Modern.js also retains SSR logs from legacy versions using `useLoader`:

| Stage         | Message                         | Level |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ----- |
| PRERENDER     | App Prerender                   | error |
