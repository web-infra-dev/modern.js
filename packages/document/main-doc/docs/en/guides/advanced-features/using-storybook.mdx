# Using Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a tool dedicated to component debugging, providing around component development.

- Develop UIs that are more durable
- Test UIs with less effort and no flakes
- Document UI for your team to reuse
- Share how the UI actually works
- Automate UI workflows

## Enable Storybook debugging

The Modern.js framework integrates the Builder's Node Polyfill plugin by default.

If you want to debug the component, you can enable Storybook debugging through `pnpm run new`.

```bash
$ npx modern new
? Please select the operation you want: Enable features
? Please select the feature name: Enable Visual Testing (Storybook)
```

After the execution is complete, you only need to register the Modern.js Storybook plugin in the `modern.config.ts` file to enable Storybook debugging capabilities.

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
import { appTools, defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';
import storybookPlugin from '@modern-js/plugin-storybook';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [appTools(), storybookPlugin()],
});
```

## Debugging code

Modern.js recognizes files in the format of [\*.stories.(js|jsx|ts|tsx|mdx)](/apis/app/hooks/src/stories.html) under the project source code directory (src/) by default as Storybook debugging files.

## Configure Storybook

In Modern.js, Storybook configuration files can be added to the [`config/storybook`](/apis/app/hooks/config/storybook.html) directory of the project.
