# Custom Web Server

Modern.js encapsulates most server-side capabilities required by projects, typically eliminating the need for server-side development. However, in certain scenarios such as user authentication, request preprocessing, or adding page skeletons, custom server-side logic may still be necessary.

Modern.js provides two types of APIs to extend the Web Server: **Middleware** and **Lifecycle Hooks**.

:::note
Middleware and Hooks only take effect when users request page routes, and BFF routes won't pass through these APIs.
:::

## Enabling Custom Web Server

Developers can execute the `pnpm run new` command in the project root directory to enable the "Custom Web Server" feature:

```bash
? Select operation: Create project element
? Select element type: Create "Custom Web Server" source directory
```

After executing the command, register the `@modern-js/plugin-server` plugin in `modern.config.ts`:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
import { serverPlugin } from '@modern-js/plugin-server';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [..., serverPlugin()],
});
```

Once enabled, a `server/index.ts` file will be automatically created in the project directory where custom logic can be implemented.

## Custom Web Server Capabilities

### Unstable Middleware

Modern.js supports adding rendering middleware to the Web Server, allowing custom logic execution before and after processing page routes.

```ts title="server/index.ts"
import {
  UnstableMiddleware,
  UnstableMiddlewareContext,
} from '@Modern.js/runtime/server';

const time: UnstableMiddleware = async (c: UnstableMiddlewareContext, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();

  await next();

  const end = Date.now();

  console.log(`dur=${end - start}`);
};

export const unstableMiddleware: UnstableMiddleware[] = [time];
```

### Hooks

:::warning
We recommend using UnstableMiddleware instead of Hooks.
:::

Modern.js provides Hooks to control specific logic in the Web Server. All page requests will pass through Hooks.

Currently, two types of Hooks are available: `AfterMatch` and `AfterRender`. Developers can implement them in `server/index.ts` as follows:

```ts
import type {
  AfterMatchHook,
  AfterRenderHook,
} from '@modern-js/runtime/server';

export const afterMatch: AfterMatchHook = (ctx, next) => {
  next();
};

export const afterRender: AfterRenderHook = (ctx, next) => {
  next();
};
```

Best practices when using Hooks:

1. Perform authorization checks in afterMatch.
2. Handle Rewrite and Redirect in afterMatch.
3. Inject HTML content in afterRender.
