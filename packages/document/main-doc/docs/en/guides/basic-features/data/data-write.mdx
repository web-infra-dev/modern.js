# Data writing

In the Data Loader chapter, the way Modern.js fetch data is introduced. You may encounter two problems.：
1. How to update the data in Data Loader？
2. How to write new data to the server?

EdenX's solution for this is DataAction.

## Basic Example

Data Action, like Data Loader, is also based on convention routing. Through Modern.js's [nested routing](/guides/basic-features/routes#routing-file-convention), each routing component (`layout.ts`, `page.ts` or `$.tsx`) can have a `data` file with the same name, and a function named `action` can be exported in the `data` file.
```bash
.
└── routes
    └── user
        ├── layout.tsx
        └── layout.data.ts
```
Define the following code in the file:
```ts title="routes/user/layout.data.ts"
import type { ActionFunction } from '@modern-js/runtime/router';

export const action: ActionFunction = ({ request }) => {
    const newUser = await request.json();
    const name = newUser.name;
    return updateUserProfile(name);
}
```

```tsx title="routes/user/layout.tsx"
import {
  useFetcher,
  useLoaderData,
  useParams,
  Outlet
} from '@modern-js/runtime/router';

export default () => {
  const userInfo = useLoaderData();
  const { submit } = useFetcher();
  const editUser = () => {
    const newUser = {
      name: 'Modern.js'
    }
    return submit(newUser, {
      method: 'post',
      encType: 'application/json',
    })
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={editUser}>edit user</button>
      <div className="user-profile">
        {userInfo}
      </div>
      <Outlet context={userInfo}></Outlet>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Here, when the submit is executed, the defined action function will be triggered; in the action function, the submitted data can be obtained through request (request.json, request.formData, etc.), and the data can be obtained, and then the data can be sent to the server.

After the action function is executed, the loader function code will be executed and the corresponding data and views will be updated.

## Why provide Data Action?

Data Action is mainly provided in Modern.js to keep the state of the UI and the server in sync, which can reduce the burden of state management.

The traditional state management method will hold the state on the client side and remotely respectively:：

![traditional state manage](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/ulkl/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/action-state-manage.png)

In Modern.js, we hope to help developers automatically synchronize the state of the client and server through Loader and Action:：

![state manage](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/ulkl/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/action-state-manage1.png)

If the data shared by the components in the project are the state of the main server, there is no need to introduce a client state management library in the project, request data through Data Loader, through [`useRouteLoaderData`](/guides/basic-fe Atures/data/data-fetch.md) shares data in subcomponents,

Modify and synchronize the state of the server through Data Action.



## `action` function

Like the `loader` function, the `action` function has two parameters, `params` and `request`:

### `params`

When the routing file passes through `[]`, it will be used as [dynamic routing](/guides/basic-features/routes#dynamic routing), and the dynamic routing fragment will be passed into the `action` function as a parameter:：

```tsx
// routes/user/[id]/page.data.ts
import { ActionFunctionArgs } from '@modern-js/runtime/router';

export const action = async ({ params }: ActionFunctionArgs) => {
  const { id } = params;
  const res = await fetch(`https://api/user/${id}`);
  return res.json();
};
```

When accessing `/user/123`, the parameter of the `action` function is `{ params: { id: '123' } }`.


### `request`

Through `request`, you can fetch data submitted by the client in the action function, such as `request.json()`, `request.formData()`, `request.json()`, etc.

For the specific API, please refer to [data type] (#data-type).

```tsx
// routes/user/[id]/page.data.ts
import { ActionFunctionArgs } from '@modern-js/runtime/router';

export const action = async ({ request }: ActionFunctionArgs) => {
  const newUser = await request.json();
  return updateUser(newUser);
};
```

### Return Value

The return value of the `action` function can be any serializable value or a [Fetch Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) instance,

The data in the response can be accessed through [`useActionData`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-action-data).


## useSubmit 和 useFetcher

### Differences

You can use [`useSubmit`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-submit) or [`useFetcher`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-fetcher) calls action, and the difference between them is through

`useSubmit` calls action, which will trigger the browser's navigation, and `useFetcher` will not trigger the browser's navigation.

useSubmit:

```ts
const submit = useSubmit();
submit(null, { method: "post", action: "/logout" });
```

useFetcher:
```ts
const { submit } = useFetcher();
submit(null, { method: "post", action: "/logout" });
```

The `submit` function has two input parameters, `method` and `action`. `method` is equivalent to `method` at the time of form submission. In most scenarios where data is written,the `method` can be passed into `post`.

`action` is used to specify which routing component `action` is triggered. If the `action` parameter is not passed in, the action of the current routing component will be triggered by default, that is,
the execution of submit in the `user/page.tsx` component or subcomponent will trigger the action defined in `user/page.data.ts`.


:::info
For more information about these two APIs, please refer to the relevant documents：
- [`useSubmit`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-submit)
- [`useFetcher`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-fetcher)

### Type of data

The first parameter of the `submit` function can accept different types of values.
Such as `FormData`：
```ts
let formData = new FormData();
formData.append("cheese", "gouda");
submit(formData);
// In the action, you can get the data by request.json
```

Or the value of type `URLSearchParams`：
```ts
let searchParams = new URLSearchParams();
searchParams.append("cheese", "gouda");
submit(searchParams);
// In the action, you can get the data by request.json
```

Or any acceptable value of the `URLSearchParams` constructor：
```ts
submit("cheese=gouda&toasted=yes");
submit([
  ["cheese", "gouda"],
  ["toasted", "yes"],
]);
// In the action, you can get the data by request.json
```

By default, if the first parameter in the `submit` function is an object, the corresponding data will be encoded as `formData`：

```ts
submit(
  { key: "value" },
  {
    method: "post",
    encType: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
  }
);

// In the action, you can get the data by request.formData
```

it can also be specified as json encoding：

```tsx
submit(
  { key: "value" },
  { method: "post", encType: "application/json" }
);

submit('{"key":"value"}', {
  method: "post",
  encType: "application/json",
});

// In the action, you can get the data by request.json
```

or submit plain text：
```ts
submit("value", { method: "post", encType: "text/plain" });
// In the action, you can get the data by request.text
```


## CSR 和 SSR

Like Data Loader, in the SSR project, Data Action is executed on the server (the framework will automatically send a request to trigger Data Action), while in the CSR project, Data Action is executed on the client.
