# Using Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a tool specifically designed for component debugging. It provides:

- A rich variety of debugging capabilities
- Integration with some testing tools
- Reusable documentation content
- Sharing capabilities
- Workflow automation

## Principle

Rsbuild provides [Storybook Rsbuild](https://storybook.rsbuild.rs/index.html), which allows any Rsbuild project to use this tool for building Storybook.

Modern.js implements `storybook-addon-modernjs` based on this tool. This plugin loads the Modern.js configuration file and converts it into a configuration usable by **Storybook Rsbuild**.

:::info
This document only provides the simplest usage. For more information, please refer to [Storybook Rsbuild Modern.js Integration](https://storybook.rsbuild.rs/guide/integrations/modernjs.html).

## Installation

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @rsbuild/core storybook-builder-rsbuild storybook-addon-modernjs -D" />

You need to install `@rsbuild/core` in your project, otherwise the plugin may not work properly.

## Configure `.storybook/main.ts`

```ts
import type { StorybookConfig } from 'storybook-react-rsbuild'

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|mjs|ts|tsx)'],
  addons: ['storybook-addon-modernjs'],
  framework: ['storybook-react-rsbuild'],
}
export default config
```

## Example
