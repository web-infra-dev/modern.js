# Deploy

Currently, Modern.js can run in the node.js environment, you can host it yourself. At the same time, Modern.js officially supports deployment on the Netlify platform.

:::info
Currently Modern.js only supports running in node.js environments, support for other runtime environments will be provided in a later version.
:::


## Commands to build products

Running the `modern deploy` command will automatically build the output file for the production environment. This process includes optimizing the output file and its dependencies, and detecting the current deployment platform and automatically generating a product that will run on that platform.

If you want to generate and test the output locally for a specific deployment platform, you can specify the platform by setting the environment variable: `modern deploy`:

```bash
MODERNJS_DEPLOY=netlify npx modern deploy
```

:::info
When deploying on the deployment platforms officially supported by Modern.js, there is no need to specify environment variables.
:::


## Node.js

### Single Repo

By default, Modern.js outputs builds that can be run in a Node.js environment when no Modern.js-supported deployment platform is detected.

Use the following command to build the project:
```bash
npx modern deploy
```

When running the `modern deploy` command, Modern.js will generate runnable products and output the following content:

```bash
Static directory: `.output/static`
You can preview this build by `node .output/index`
```

At this point, you can run the entire server by `node .output/index`, and the static resources required for the page are in the `.output/static` directory. You can upload these static resources to a CDN yourself:

:::info
By default, when running Modern.js Server, it listens on port 8080. If you want to change the listening port, you can specify the `PORT` environment variable:
```
PORT=3000 node .output/index
```
:::


### Monorepo

For the Monorepo project, in addition to building our current project, we also need to build other repositories that the current project depends on.

We assume that the name in the `package.json` of the current project is `app`. Taking pnpm as an example of a monorepo management tool, you can add the following command to the `package.json` of the current project to build products for the current project:

```json title="app/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "modern deploy",
    "deploy:app": "pnpm --filter 'app^...' run build && pnpm --filter=app run deploy",
  }
}
```

If you use rush to manage repositories, you can add the following command in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "modern deploy",
    "deploy:app": "rush rebuild --to-except app && rushx deploy",
  }
}
```

After the build is completed, Modern.js will generate all dependencies in the `.output/node_modules` directory of the project. Similarly, you can run the entire server using `node .output/index`.

## Netlify

Netlify is a popular web development platform designed for building, deploying, and maintaining modern web projects. Deploying on Netlify mainly requires configuring the `netlify.toml` file.

Depending on the complexity of your project, you can configure it incrementally by this doc.

### Pure Front-end Project

Add the `netlify.toml` file to the root directory of the current project:

```bash
./
├── src/
├── modern.config.ts
├── netlify.toml
├── package.json
```

Add the following content to `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run deploy"
```

Add a project to the Netlify platform and deploy it!

### Full Stack Project

Full-stack projects refer to projects that use custom servers, SSR, and BFF. These projects need to be deployed on Netlify Functions. Based on the `netlify.toml` file mentioned above,
add the following configuration:

```toml title="netlify.toml"
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run deploy"

[functions]
  directory = ".netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "none"
  included_files = [".netlify/functions/**"]

```

:::info
Currently, Modern.js does not support deployment on Netlify Edge Functions. We will support it in future versions.
:::


### Monorepo

For Monorepo projects, in addition to building our current project, we also need to build the dependencies of the current project from other repositories.
We take a pnpm monorepo repository as an example and deploy the Monorepo project on Netlify.

Suppose we have the following Monorepo repository:

```
./
├── packages/
│   ├── app/
│   └── app-dep1
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

We need to configure Base directory on the netlify platform as `packages/app`:

<img src="https://sf16-sg.tiktokcdn.com/obj/eden-sg/lmeh7nuptpfnuhd/netlify-monorepo-basedir.png?x-resource-account=public" />

Add the following script in `packages/app/package.json`, before executing the deployment command of the `app` repository, first execute the build of other repositories in the workspace:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy:app": "pnpm --filter 'app^...' run build && pnpm --filter=app run deploy",
}
```

Configure the build command in `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run deploy:app"

[functions]
  directory = ".netlify/functions"
  node_bundler = "none"
  included_files = [".netlify/functions/**"]
```

Just submit your code and deploy it using the Netlify platform.
