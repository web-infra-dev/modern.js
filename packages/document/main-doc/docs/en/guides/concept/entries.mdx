# Page Entry

In this chapter, you will learn about the entry convention in Modern.js and how to customize it.

## What is Entry?

**Entry refers to the starting module of a page.**

In a Modern.js project, each entry corresponds to an independent page and a server-side route. By default, Modern.js automatically determines the entry of a page based on directory conventions, but also supports customizing the entry through configuration options.

Many configuration options provided by Modern.js are divided by entry, such as page title, HTML template, page meta information, whether to enable SSR/SSG, server-side routing rules, etc.

## Single Entry and Multiple Entries

The project initialized by Modern.js is a single entry project, with the following structure:

```
.
├── src
│   └── routes
│       ├── index.css
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       └── page.tsx
├── package.json
├── modern.config.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

In a Modern.js project, you can easily switch from single entry to multiple entries by running `pnpm run new` in the project directory and creating an entry:

```text
? Please select the operation you want: Create Element
? Please select the type of element to create: New "entry"
? Please fill in the entry name: new-entry
```

After running the command, Modern.js will automatically generate a new entry directory. At this point, you can see that the `src/` directory has the following structure:

```bash
.
├── myapp     # Original entry
│   └── routes
│       ├── index.css
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       └── page.tsx
└── new-entry  # New entry
    └── routes
        ├── index.css
        ├── layout.tsx
        └── page.tsx
```

The original entry code has been moved to a directory with the same name as the `name` field in `package.json`, and a `new-entry` entry directory has been created.

Modern.js will use the entry with the same name as the `name` field in `package.json` as the main entry. The route of the main entry is `/`, and the route of other entries is `/{entryName}`.

You can run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server. At this point, you will see a new route named `/new-entry` added, and the existing page routes remain unchanged.

:::note
The concepts of **single entry/multiple entry** and **SPA/MPA** are not equivalent. The former pertains to how to configure and package the application, while the latter is about the patterns for organizing front-end applications. Each entry point can be either an SPA or a non-SPA.
:::

## Entry Types

Different entry types have different compilation and runtime behaviors.

import EntryMode from '@site-docs-en/components/entry-mode.mdx';

<EntryMode />

By default, Modern.js scans the files under `src/` before starting the project, identifies the entry, and generates the corresponding server-side route.

:::tip

- You can custom the recognition directory for page entries by using [source.entriesDir](/configure/app/source/entries-dir).
- If you need to customize the entry points, please refer to [Custom Entries](#custom-entries).

:::

The entry directory must meet one of the following three conditions:

1. Has a `routes/` directory.
2. Has an `App.[jt]sx?` file.
5. Has an `entry.[jt]sx?` file.(Requires [source.enableCustomEntry](/configure/app/source/enable-custom-entry) to be enabled)

When the `src/` directory meets the conditions of an entry, Modern.js will consider the current application to be a single-entry application. Otherwise, Modern.js will scan the first-level directories under `src/` and further determine if they are entries. In this case, the application is typically a multi-entry application.

:::tip
In a single entry application, the default entry name is `main`.

:::

### Framework Mode Entry

Framework mode refers to using Modern.js's framework capabilities, such as convention routing, SSR (Server-Side Rendering), and integrated calls. Under this type of entry convention, the entries in the application are not the actual compilation entries. Modern.js will generate a wrapped entry during startup, which you can find in `node_modules/.modern/[entryName]/index.js`.

#### Conventional Routing

If there is a `routes/` directory within the entry, we refer to this entry as a convention-based route. Modern.js will scan the files under `routes/` during startup and automatically generate client-side routes (react-router) based on file conventions. For example:

```bash
.
├── src
│   └── routes
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       └── page.tsx
```

In the above directory, the component exported in `layout.tsx` will be the outermost component, and the component exported in `page.tsx` will be the component of the `/` route.

For more information, please refer to [Conventional Routing](/guides/basic-features/routes.html#conventional-routing).

#### Self-controlled Routing

If there is an `App.[jt]sx?` file within the entry, we refer to this entry as a self-controlled route. For example:

```bash
.
├── src
│   └── App.tsx
```

In this file, you can define client-side routes or  not to set any client-side routes.

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from '@modern-js/runtime/router';

export default () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route index element={<div>index</div>} />
        <Route path="about" element={<div>about</div>} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};
```

For more information, please refer to [Self-controlled Routing](/guides/basic-features/routes.html#self-controlled-routing).

#### Custom Entry

:::info
Using this features requires enabling [source.enableCustomEntry](/configure/app/source/enable-custom-entry).
:::

By default, whether you use convention routing or self-controlled routing, Modern.js will automatically handle rendering. If you wish to customize this behavior, you can creating a custom entry file.

If there is an `entry.[jt]sx` file within the entry, Modern.js will no longer control the application's rendering process. You can call the `createRoot` and `render` functions within the `entry.[jt]sx` file to complete the entry logic for your application.

```tsx
import { createRoot } from '@modern-js/runtime/react';
import { render } from '@modern-js/runtime/browser';

const ModernRoot = createRoot();

render(<ModernRoot />);
```

In the code above, the component returned by the `createRoot` function is either the component generated from the `routes/` directory or the component exported by `App.tsx`. 

The `render` function is used to handle rendering and mounting of the component. For example, if you want to execute some asynchronous tasks before rendering, you can achieve it like this:

```tsx
import { createRoot } from '@modern-js/runtime/react';
import { render } from '@modern-js/runtime/browser';

const ModernRoot = createRoot();

async function beforeRender() {
  // some async request
}

beforeRender().then(() => {
  render(<ModernRoot />);
});
```

### Build Mode Entry

:::info
Using this features requires enabling [source.enableCustomEntry](/configure/app/source/enable-custom-entry).
:::

Build mode refers to the development mode that does not use Modern.js's runtime capabilities and only utilizes Modern.js's build capabilities. When the `@modern-js/runtime` dependency is not installed in the application, Modern.js will treat all entries as build mode entries.

In this case, if there is an `entry.[jt]sx` file within the entry, this file will be recognized as the build entry for webpack or Rspack. Modern.js will not automatically generate entry code at this time, and you need to mount the component to the DOM node yourself. For example:

```js title=src/entry.tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In build mode, the application **will not be able to use Modern.js's runtime capabilities**, such as:
- Convention routing, the routing based on the files under `src/routes`
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- The `runtime` configuration in the `modern.config.js` file will no longer take effect


## Specify entry in the configuration file

In some cases, you may need to customize the entry configuration instead of using the entry conventions provided by Modern.js.

For example, if you want to migrate a non-Modern.js project to Modern.js and it is not structured according to Modern.js directory structure, there might be some migration costs involved in changing it to the conventional structure. In such cases, you can custom the entries.

Modern.js provides the following configuration options that you can set in [modern.config.ts](/configure/app/usage):

- [source.entries](/configure/app/source/entries): Used to set custom entry objects.
- [source.disableDefaultEntries](/configure/app/source/disable-default-entries): Used to disable Modern.js's default entry scanning behavior. When you use custom entries, parts of your project structure might coincidentally match the Modern.js conventional directory structure, but you may not want Modern.js to generate entry configurations for them. Enabling this option can help avoid this issue.

### Example

Here is an example of a custom entry point. You can also refer to the documentation of the corresponding configuration options for more usage.

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  source: {
    entries: {
      // Specify an entry named 'my-entry'
      'my-entry': {
        // Path to the entry module
        entry: './src/my-page/index.tsx',
        // Disable automatic generation of entry code by Modern.js
        disableMount: true,
      },
    },
    // Disable entry scanning behavior
    disableDefaultEntries: true,
  },
});
```

It is worth noting that, by default, Modern.js considers entries specified through the configuration as **framework mode entries** and will automatically generate the actual compilation entry. 

If your application is migrating from build tools like Webpack or Vite to the Modern.js framework, you typically need to enable the `disableMount` option in the entry configuration. In this case, Modern.js will treat the entry as a **build mode entry**.

## Deprecated

Currently, if the entry directory meets the following conditions, it will also be considered an application entry:

1. Has an `index.[jt]sx?` file.
2. Has a `pages/` directory.

The `pages/` directory was the convention routing in older versions of Modern.js. Now, it is recommended to use the `routes/` directory.

The `index.[jt]sx?` file supported **Custom Bootstrap** and **Build Mode Entry** in older versions. Now, it is recommended to use `entry.[jt]sx?` instead.

### Custom Bootstrap

When there is an `index.[jt]sx` file in the entry, and  the file's default export is a function, Modern.js will pass the default `bootstrap` function as an argument and use the exported function to replace the default `bootstrap`. 

This allows developers to customize mounting components to DOM or add custom behaviors before mounting. For example:

```tsx
export default (App: React.ComponentType, bootstrap: () => void) => {
  // do something before bootstrap...
  initSomething().then(() => {
    bootstrap();
  });
};
```

### Build Mode Entry

When an `index.[jt]sx` file exists in the entry directory and does not export a function via export default, this entry will also be considered a build mode entry.
