# Upgrade

## Upgrade with command

Modern.js provides the `upgrade` command to support upgrading the project to the latest version of Modern.js.

Run `pnpm run upgrade` in the project:

```bash
$ pnpm run upgrade

> modern upgrade

[INFO] [Project Type]: Web App
[INFO] [Modern.js Latest Version]: 2.0.0
[INFO] Upgrade Modern.js package version success!
```

You can see that the dependencies in the project's `package.json` have been updated to the latest version.

## Upgrade to a specified version

All packages of Modern.js are currently released with a **uniform version number**.

import ReleaseNote from "@site-docs-en/components/release-note"

<ReleaseNote />

:::tip
When upgrading, you need to upgrade all packages provided by Modern.js, instead of upgrading a single dependency.

:::

## Lock nested dependency

When a nested dependency of the project has a problem and Modern.js cannot be updated immediately, you can use the package manager to lock the version of the nested dependency.

### pnpm

For projects using pnpm, add the following configuration to the `package.json` in the **root directory** of the project, and then run `pnpm install` again:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "package-name": "^1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Yarn

For projects using Yarn, add the following configuration to the `package.json` in the **root directory** of the project, and then run `yarn install` again:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "resolutions": {
    "package-name": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Npm

For projects using Npm, add the following configuration to the `package.json` in the **root directory** of the project, and then run `npm install` again:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "overrides": {
    "package-name": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

:::info
For Monorepo repositories, you can only lock dependency versions in the `package.json` in the root directory of the project, and it will affect all packages in the Monorepo.
