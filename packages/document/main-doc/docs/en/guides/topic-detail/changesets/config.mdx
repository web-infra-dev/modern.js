# Changesets Configuration

When initializing a Modern.js repository, the configuration file for changesets will be initialized by default, that is, the `.changeset/config.json` file. Below, we will learn in detail what configurations are supported in this file.

## Introduction

### commit

Type: `boolean`

Default: `false`

When this field is configured as `true`, the code submission operation will be automatically executed when running the `change` and `bump` commands.

The default commit information format is as follows:

![change commit](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/zq-uylkvT/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/changeset-change-commit-info.png)
![bump commit](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/zq-uylkvT/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/changeset-bump-commit-info.png)

This commit information supports customization, which we will discuss in detail in the [Customizing Commit Messages](/guides/topic-detail/changesets/commit) chapter.

### access

Type: `restricted` | `public`

Default: `restricted`

Used to configure the publishing form of the current package. If configured as `restricted`, it will be published as a private package. If it is `public`, it will be published as a public scope package.

For packages that need to configure access in the repository, `publishConfig` can be configured in `package.json`, for example:

```json title=package.json
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/",
    "access": "public"
  }
}
```

For packages that don't need to be published, you can set `private` to `true` in `package.json` to prevent them from being published.

### baseBranch

Type: `string`

Default: `main`

Repository main branch. This configuration is used to calculate the changed packages of the current branch and classify them.

### ignore

Type: `string[]`

Default: `[]`

Used to declare packages to be ignored when running the `bump` command. The usage is consistent with the `--ignore` parameter of the `bump` command. Note that the two cannot be used at the same time.

### fixed

Type: `string[][]`

Default: `[]`

Used to group packages in monorepos. The version of packages in the same group will be bound, and each time the `bump` command is run, a package in the same group is upgraded, others will be upgraded together.
Regular expressions can be used to match package names.

### linked

Type: `string[][]`

Default: `[]`

Similar to `fixed`, it also groups packages in monorepos, but only the packages related to the changeset declaration will be upgraded when the `bump` command is run, and the version of the changeset packages in the same group will remain consistent.
Regular expressions can be used to match package names.

### updateInternalDependencies

Type: `patch` | `minor`

Default: `patch`

Used to declare the version number rule for updating internal dependencies.

When upgrading the version number by running the `bump` command, the dependency declaration using the package in the repository will be automatically updated by default. After configuring this field as `minor`, if the version number is upgraded to `patch`, the reference dependency declaration will not be updated automatically.

For example:

```
pkg-a @ version 1.0.0
pkg-b @ version 1.0.0
  depends on pkg-a at range `^1.0.0
```

By default, when upgrading `pkg-a` to `1.0.1`, the dependency version of `pkg-a` in `pkg-b` will be updated to `^1.0.1`.

When configuring `updateInternalDependencies` as `minor`, when upgrading `pkg-a` to `1.0.1`, the dependency version of `pkg-a` in `pkg-b` will not be updated. Only when the version number of `pkg-a` is upgraded to `1.1.0` or `2.0.0`, the dependency of `pkg-a` in `pkg-b` will be updated.

### changelog

Type: `boolean` | `string` | `[string, unknow]`

Default: `@changesets/cli/changelog`

The rule for generating changelog.

When configured as `false`, only the version number will be declared in the `CHANGELOG.md` file when running the `bump` command, and no other changelog information will be declared.

![Close changelog configuration](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/zq-uylkvT/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/changeset-empty-changelog.png)

When configured as `@changesets/cli/changelog`, the official provided changelog generation rule will be used to convert the changeset information into changelog content.

When configured as an array, the first parameter is a custom NPM package or path, and the second parameter is the default parameter configuration that needs to be passed in. We will explain the custom format in the subsequent [Custom Changelog](/guides/topic-detail/changesets/changelog) section.

### \_\_\_experimentalUnsafeOptions_WILL_CHANGE_IN_PATCH

Some experimental configurations.

#### onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange

Type: `boolean`

Default: `false`

Configuration for the upgrade strategy of `peerDependence` dependencies. By default, when `peerDependence` is upgraded to a `minor` or `major` version, the current package will be upgraded to a major version.

When this configuration is set to `true`, the version will only be updated when the declared dependencies of `peerDependence` are outside the declared range.

#### updateInternalDependents

Type: `always` | `out-of-range`

Default: `always`

When upgrading the version number by running the `bump` command, the dependency declaration using the package in the repository will be automatically updated by default. When this parameter is set to `out-of-range`, the dependency declaration using the package in the repository will be updated only when it is outside the declared range.

#### useCalculatedVersionForSnapshots

Type: `boolean`

Default: `false`

When publishing snapshots, the version format of `0.0.0-timestamp` will be used by default to ensure that users can use pre-release versions normally. When you need to ignore the above problem and use the normal version number format, that is, the current version is `1.0.1`, and the snapshot version is expected to use `1.0.1-timestamp`, you can configure this parameter as `true`.
