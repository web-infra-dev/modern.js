# Introducing Changesets

Modern.js integrates [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for package version management in Npm Module and Monorepo project.

## Features

Changesets have the following features:

- During development, developers need to provide the package names, the type of version upgrade (`pathch`, `minor`, `major`), and change information involved in this change.

- When releasing a version, the version number of the corresponding package will be automatically upgraded based on the content of the changeset, and changelog information will be generated in the corresponding package.

- In the Monorepo project, changesets will automatically generate a repository dependency graph, and only upgrade the version numbers of the changed packages and related dependent packages during upgrade.

## Initialization

The Npm Module and Monorepo project created by Modern.js have already initialized changesets. The `.changeset` directory and the configuration file `.changeset/config.json` will be automatically created in the project root directory.

In addition, Modern.js provides corresponding commands for changesets in its corresponding project tools `@modern-js/module-tools` and `@modern-js/monorepo-tools`, and there is no need to manually install changeset-related dependencies.

The default configuration for changesets is as follows:

```json title=".changeset/config.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://unpkg.com/@changesets/config@2.0.0/schema.json",
  "changelog": "@changesets/cli/changelog",
  "commit": false,
  "linked": [],
  "access": "restricted",
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "updateInternalDependencies": "patch",
  "ignore": []
}
```

The configuration file provides some basic configurations for generating changesets. For detailed field descriptions, please refer to [Changesets configuration](/guides/topic-detail/changesets/config).

## Commands

- `change`: Creates a changeset. After running this command, a changeset file will be automatically generated in the `.changeset` directory.

- `bump`: Upgrades the version of the corresponding package based on the current changeset.

- `pre`: Marks entering and exiting `pre release` mode. When running the `bump` command in `pre release` mode, the version format will be `x.x.x-${pre-tag}.x`.

- `release`: Publishes the package to NPM.

- `status`: Views the current changeset status.

- `gen-release-note`: Generates Release Note information based on the current chagneset status.

For specific command-supported parameters, please refer to the corresponding chapter introduction.
