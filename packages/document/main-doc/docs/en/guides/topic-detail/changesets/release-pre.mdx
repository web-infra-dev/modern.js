# Publishing Pre-Release Version

Before doing an actual release, we also need to publish a pre-release version for internal testing and user use. Changesets also support publishing pre-release versions.

## Steps

:::info
The following example commands are all using pnpm. If you need to use other package managers, please replace them as needed.
:::

#### Run the bump command to upgrade the version of the pre-release

```bash
pnpm run bump --canary --preid <preid>
```

`preid` is the tag for the pre-release version, such as `alpha`, `beta`, etc., and the default value is `next`.

After using the `--canary` parameter, the `bump` command completes the following three steps:

- `changeset pre enter <preid>`: Enters pre-release mode.

- `changeset version`: Upgrades the version.

- `changeset pre exit`: Exits pre-release mode.

#### Check the changes and submit

Check whether the version changes are correct and submit the changes.

It is recommended to perform pre-release operations not on the main branch and not merge them into the main branch. After the pre-release verification is completed, an actual version can be directly released based on the main branch.

#### Run the release command to publish the pre-release version:

```bash
pnpm run release --tag <tag>
```

When publishing a pre-release version, you must use the `--tag` parameter. The parameter value is best the same as the `preid` value to facilitate user use.

## Notes

### Exiting pre-release mode

After entering pre-release mode, changesets will automatically create a `pre.json` file in the `.changeset` directory to record some status information when entering pre-release mode. When the status information is inconsistent with the current repository status, you can directly delete this file to exit pre-release mode.
