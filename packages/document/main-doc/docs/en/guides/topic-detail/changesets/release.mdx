# Publishing version

When releasing a version, we need to upgrade the version numbers of the corresponding packages based on the changeset generated during development, and execute the publish command to publish them to NPM.

## Steps

:::info
The following example commands are all using pnpm as the package management tool. If you need to use other package management tools, please replace them as needed.

:::

### Npm Module

#### Run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
pnpm run bump
```

![](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/zq-uylkvT/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/changeset-module-bump.png)

When running this command, changesets will automatically perform the following operations:

- Delete all changeset files under the `.changesets` directory.

- Upgrade the package version number based on the changeset information.

- Write Changelog information to the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the root directory. The file will be automatically created if it does not exist.

#### Confirm and submit the current changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "release: bump package"
```

#### Run the following command in the root directory to publish the package to NPM:

```bash
pnpm run release
```

![](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/zq-uylkvT/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/changeset-module-release.png)

#### Push the corresponding tag information to the remote repository:

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```

### Monorepo

#### Run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
pnpm run bump
```

![](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/zq-uylkvT/ljhwZthlaukjlkulzlp/changeset-monorepo-bump.png)

When running this command, changesets will automatically perform the following operations:

- Delete all changeset files under the `.changesets` directory.

- Upgrade the version numbers of the relevant packages based on the changeset information. In addition to the packages written in the changeset, changesets will also analyze the dependency relationships of all packages in the Monorepo during execution. If an upgrade is required, the version number will be automatically upgraded accordingly.

- Write Changelog information to the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the directory of the package that needs to be upgraded. The file will be automatically created if it does not exist.

#### Confirm and submit the current changes:

:::info
Make sure that the automatically upgraded version numbers meet the expected requirements. If you need to understand the version upgrade strategy, please refer to [Version Upgrade Strategy](/guides/topic-detail/changesets/release#version-upgrade-strategy).
:::

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "release: bump package"
```

#### Run the following command in the root directory to publish the package to NPM:

```bash
pnpm run release
```

When running this command, it will sequentially determine whether the versions of all packages in the Monorepo exist on NPM. If they do not exist, the `publish` command will be executed to publish them.

:::warning
When the dependencies between packages in the Monorepo are declared using workspace, do not directly execute `npm publish` to publish the package in the corresponding subdirectory of the package. Use the `release` command instead. When publishing, the workspace declaration will be automatically removed to ensure that the NPM package is available after publishing.
:::

#### Push the corresponding tag information to the remote repository:

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```

## Parameters

### Parameters for the `bump` command

- `--snapshot` Generates a timestamp-based version number.

```bash
pnpm run bump --snapshot canary
```

After running, the corresponding upgraded version number will become `0.0.0-canary-20220622092823`, and `canary` is the tag configured for snapshot. If not configured, it will directly generate the form of `0.0.0-20220622092823`.

This parameter is mainly used to publish temporary test versions for testing and does not require code submission.

- `--ignore` Manually ignore some packages during publishing.

For example, if you need to ignore the `module-2` package for this release:

```bash
pnpm run bump --ignore module-2
```

After executing the command, the update of the `module-2` package will be ignored. Note that if there are packages that depend on `module-2`, the corresponding packages also need to be added to the `ignore` parameter, otherwise the `bump` command will fail.

The usage for adding multiple packages is as follows:

```bash
pnpm run bump --ignore module-2 --ignore module-3
```

### Parameters for the `release` command

- `--otp` Uses `npm token` to execute the release command to publish the corresponding package.

```bash
pnpm run relese --otp <token>
```

- `--tag` Uses a specific tag for local publishing, and `latest` is used by default.

```bash
pnpm run release --tag <tag>
```

- `--ignore-scripts` Ignores npm scripts during publishing.

When executing the `publish` command, npm will automatically trigger many commands, such as `prepare` and `prepublish`. Using this parameter can ignore the execution of these commands. This parameter is only supported in Monorepo using pnpm.

```bash
pnpm run release --ignore-scripts
```

- `--no-git-checks` Ignores checking the current branch during publishing.

By default, when executing the publish command, it will automatically check whether the current branch is a release branch, whether there are uncommitted changes, etc. Using this parameter can ignore git-related checks.

```bash
pnpm run release --no-git-checks
```

## Version Upgrade Strategy

### dependencies or devDependencies dependencies

#### Only upgrade the patch version of the package itself for patch version dependencies

For example, the following scenario exists:

There are two packages in Monorepo, `module-1` and `module-2`, and `module-1` exists in the `dependencies` of `module-2`.

The current changeset is the patch version upgrade of `module-1`.

After executing the bump command, only the patch version number of `module-1` will be upgraded.

#### Upgrade the major or minor version number of the package itself for major/minor version upgrades, and upgrade the patch version number of the dependent packages

For example, the following scenario exists:

There are two packages in Monorepo, `module-1` and `module-2`, and `module-1` exists in the `dependencies` of `module-2`.

The current changeset is the minor version upgrade of `module-1`.

After executing the bump command, `module-1` will upgrade the `minor` version number, and `module-2` will upgrade the `patch` version number.

### peerDependencies dependencies

#### Upgrade the patch version number of the package itself and the dependent package for patch version dependencies

For example, the following scenario exists:

There are two packages in Monorepo, `module-1` and `module-2`, and `module-1` exists in the `peerDependencies` of `module-2`.

The current changeset is the patch version upgrade of `module-1`.

After executing the bump command, both `module-1` and `module-2` will upgrade the patch version number.

#### Upgrade the major version number of the dependent package for major/minor version upgrades of the package itself

For example, the following scenario exists:

There are two packages in Monorepo, `module-1` and `module-2`, and `module-1` exists in the `peerDependencies` of `module-2`.

The current changeset is the minor version upgrade of `module-1`.

After executing the bump command, `module-1` will upgrade the `minor` version number, and `module-2` will upgrade the `major` version number.

#### Modify the upgrade strategy for peerDependencies

The upgrade strategy of `peerDependencies` can be modified by configuring `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange`. When only the declared version type range is exceeded, the corresponding `peerDependencies` will be upgraded.

```json
{
  "___experimentalUnsafeOptions_WILL_CHANGE_IN_PATCH": {
    "onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange": true
  },
  ...
}
```

For example, the following scenario exists:

There are two packages in Monorepo, `module-1` and `module-2`, and `module-1` exists in the `peerDependencies` of `module-2`, and the version number of `module-1` is declared using `^`.

The current changeset is the patch or minor version upgrade of `module-1`.

After executing the `bump` command, only the version number of `module-1` will be upgraded.

Note that if the package version number is in the `0.x.x` range, upgrading the `minor` version number is also beyond the declared version type range.
