# isFileExist

Determine if the file exists.

The method is available directly on the context.

Its type is defined as:

```ts
export interface IPluginContext {
  isFileExist: (fileName: string) => Promise<boolean>;
  ...
}
```

## fileName

The file name or file path that needs to be judged is based on the relative path of the created project.
