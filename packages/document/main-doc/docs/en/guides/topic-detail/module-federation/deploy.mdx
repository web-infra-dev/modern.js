# Deployment

In general, when deploying a Module Federation application, there are two key points to consider:

1. Ensure that the remote module addresses in the consumer's configuration file are correct, and that the consumer can correctly access the producer's `manifest` file.
2. Ensure that all resources in the producer's `manifest` file can be accessed correctly.

We recommend using Modern.js's [Node Server](/guides/basic-features/deploy.html#using-modernjs-built-in-nodejs-server) to deploy Module Federation applications for an out-of-the-box experience.

## Consumer

For the consumer of Module Federation, its connection with the producer is the remote module address in the configuration file.

For example, if the producer is deployed under the domain `https://my-remote-module`, the developer needs to modify the consumer's configuration file:

```ts title="module-federation.config.ts"
import { createModuleFederationConfig } from '@module-federation/modern-js';

export default createModuleFederationConfig({
  name: 'host',
  remotes: {
    remote: 'remote@https://my-remote-module/static/mf-manifest.json',
  },
  shared: {
    react: { singleton: true },
    'react-dom': { singleton: true },
  },
});
```

At this point, the consumer will load the `manifest` configuration file of the remote module production environment.

:::note
In the above code, the address of the remote module is `/static/mf-manifest.json`, which is just an example using the default output path of Modern.js. In actual projects, developers need to configure according to the actual access path.

## Producer

For the producer of Module Federation, developers need to correctly configure the [`output.assetPrefix`](/configure/app/output/asset-prefix) configuration, which affects:

1. The `publicPath` defined in `mf-manifest.json`, which determines the access path of other resources of the remote module.
2. The access path of the `mf-manifest.json` file when hosted directly by the Modern.js server.

In the production environment, developers need to configure `output.assetPrefix` as the access path of the production environment. For example, if we deploy the producer under the domain `https://my-remote-module`, we need to configure `output.assetPrefix` as `https://my-remote-module`.

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';

export default defineConfig({
  output: {
    assetPrefix: 'https://my-remote-module',
  },
});
```

At this point, the `publicPath` defined in the producer's build output `mf-manifest.json` is `https://my-remote-module`, for example:

```json
{
  "id": "remote",
  "name": "remote",
  "metaData": {
    "name": "remote",
    "publicPath": "https://my-remote-module/"
  },
  "shared": [ /* xxx */ ],
  "remotes": [],
  "exposes": [ /* xxx */ ]
}
```

When the consumer accesses the remote module, it will automatically prepend the `publicPath` to the resource path of the remote module.

This configuration will also affect the access path of the producer's `mf-manifest.json`. For example, if this value is set to `MyDomain/module-a`, the hosting path of `mf-manifest.json` becomes `MyDomain/module-a/static/mf-manifest.json`.

At this point, the consumer needs to configure the following address when configuring the remote module:

```ts title="module-federation.config.ts"
import { createModuleFederationConfig } from '@module-federation/modern-js';

export default createModuleFederationConfig({
  name: 'host',
  remotes: {
    remote: 'remote@MyDomain/module-a/static/mf-manifest.json',
  },
});
```

## Local Deployment Verification

Modern.js provides the `modern deploy` command, which can easily generate products that can run in a Node.js environment.

```bash
modern deploy
```

After executing the command, you can see the following output in the console:

```bash
Static directory: .output/static
You can preview this build by node .output/index
```

At this point, the developer only needs to run `node .output/index` to preview the effect locally. Whether it is a CSR or an SSR application, all Module Federation files can be accessed correctly.
