# Server-Side Rendering

`@module-federation/modern-js` offers powerful capabilities, enabling developers to easily combine Module Federation with server-side rendering (SSR) in Modern.js applications.

## Enable SSR

Using the application created in [Using Module Federation](/guides/topic-detail/module-federation/usage) as an example, you only need to add the `server.ssr` configuration to both the producer and the consumer:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
import { appTools, defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    ssr: {
      mode: 'stream',
    },
  },
});
```

For better performance, we only support using this capability combination in Streaming SSR scenarios.

:::warning
Currently, `@module-federation/bridge-react` is not compatible with the Node environment. You must remove it from the dependencies to use Module Federation and server-side rendering correctly. This means Bridge cannot work with server-side rendering.
