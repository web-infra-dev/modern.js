# SSG Plugin

SSG (Static Site Generation) is a technical solution that renders complete static web pages at build time based on data and templates. This means that in a production environment, pages are populated with content by default and can be cached by a CDN. For pages that do not require dynamic data, SSG can provide better performance and higher security.
