## What is the relationship between Modern.js Module and Rsbuild?

Modern.js Module uses esbuild to build toolkits and component libraries, and Rsbuild focuses on solving web application building scenarios.

## Can Modern.js Module use webpack plugins or loaders?

Modern.js Module is based on esbuild for building and cannot use tools from the webpack-related ecosystem.
You can find more community plugins for esbuild [here](https://github.com/esbuild/community-plugins)

If the UMD product produced by Modern.js Module does not meet your requirements, you can use Rsbuild and add [UMD Plugin](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-plugin-umd) to build UMD products.
