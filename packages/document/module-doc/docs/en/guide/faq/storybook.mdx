## Storybook v7 Support

Storybook v7 does not support it yet. Rspack builds are currently planned to be supported in Storybook v7, so progress will be slower.

Related Issue: [#3376](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/modern.js/issues/3376).

## Using Storybook Addon or other configurations does not work

Modern.js Module is currently using Storybook version v6, if you are using Addon version v7 you may not be able to get the addon to work.

In addition to the Addon, other configurations may also have differences. For example, if you modify the `preview.js` configuration file, Storybook v6 is written differently than v7:

- v6：[Document](https://storybook.js.org/docs/6.5/react/writing-stories/decorators#global-decorators)
- v7：[Document](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/decorators#global-decorators)

## Cannot find module 'react-dom/package.json

When debug Storybook, the following problem occurs:

```bash
ERR! Error: Cannot find module 'react-dom/package.json'
```

You can install the react-dom dependency in the project.

``` json
{
    "devDependencies": {
        "react-dom": "^17"
    }
}
```

## Unable to locate the specific error message

Solutions:

1. Find `@storybook/core-server/dist/cjs/dev-server.js`
2. Find this code: `var _await$Promise$all = await Promise.all([preview, manager,`.
3. Modify it：

``` js
var _await$Promise$all = await Promise.all([
    preview.catch(e => console.info(e)),
    manager // TODO #13083 Restore this when compiling the preview is fast enough
  // .then((result) => {
  //   if (!options.ci && !options.smokeTest) openInBrowser(address);
  //   return result;
  // })
  .catch(previewBuilder.bail)]),
      _await$Promise$all2 = _slicedToArray(_await$Promise$all, 2),
      previewResult = _await$Promise$all2[0],
      managerResult = _await$Promise$all2[1]; // TODO #13083 Remove this when compiling the preview is fast enough
```

## Can`t find any stories is your Storybook

![storybook-error](https://lf3-static.bytednsdoc.com/obj/eden-cn/shylnyhaeh7uldvivhn/01719a11-1939-4009-9317-5e2b491ae52f.png)

When you get a problem like this, you can first open the browser console and there should be some error messages. You can use the error messages to deduce if there is a problem in the code you are writing that is causing Storybook to not work properly.

## Storybook Adds Proxy Functionality

Storybook does not provide a solution for this, but there is one in the Storybook Issue. In the Modern.js Module, you can:

1. Add the `config/storybook/middleware.js` file and initialize the following:

``` js
/* eslint-disable filenames/match-exported */
module.exports = function expressMiddleware(router) {
    // router is express router
    // import { Router } from 'express'
    // router = new Router();
};
```

2. add `http-proxy-middleware` dependency
3. Add proxy routing-related configuration

``` js
/* eslint-disable filenames/match-exported */
const { createProxyMiddleware } = require("http-proxy-middleware");

module.exports = function expressMiddleware (router) {
  router.use('/api', createProxyMiddleware({
    target: "http://localhost:8000",
    changeOrigin: true
  }))
}
```

## Modify the directory where the Story file exists

The directory where Story files are stored cannot be modified at the moment, only the `*.stories.(t|j)s(x)` and `*.stories.md(x)` files in the `your-project/stories` directory are recognized as Story files.
