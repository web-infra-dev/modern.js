# Import Plugin

Using [SWC](https://swc.rs/) provides the same ability and configuration as [`babel-plugin-import`](https://github.com/umijs/babel-plugin-import).

:::tip
As of @modern-js/module-tools version 2.16.0, this plugin functionality is built into module-tools and is provided by [`transformImport`](api/config/build-config.html#transformimport).
:::

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
# npm
npm install @modern-js/plugin-module-import -D

# yarn
yarn add @modern-js/plugin-module-import -D

# pnpm
pnpm add @modern-js/plugin-module-import -D
```

### Register

In Module Tools, you can register plugins in the following way:

```ts
import moduleTools, defineConfig from '@modern-js/module-tools';
import moduleImport from '@modern-js/plugin-module-import';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    moduleTools(),
    moduleImport({
      pluginImport: [{
        libraryName: 'antd',
        style: true,
      }],
    }),
  ],
});
```

This way we can use the ability of automatic import in Module Tools.

## Configurations

* **Type**:

```ts
type Options = {
  pluginImport?: ImportItem[];
}
```

### pluginImport

* **Type**: `Array`

The elements of the array are configuration objects for `babel-plugin-import`, which can be referred to [options](https://github.com/umijs/babel-plugin-import#options)ã€‚

**Example:**

```ts
import moduleImport from '@modern-js/plugin-module-import';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    moduleImport({
      pluginImport: [
        // babel-plugin-import`s options config
        {
          libraryName: 'foo',
          style: true,
        }
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Notes

[SWC](https://swc.rs/) (Speedy Web Compiler) is written in Rust, and this plugin is based on SWC and ported from [babel-plugin-import](https://github.com/umijs/babel-plugin-import). The configuration options remain consistent.

Some configurations can accept functions, such as `customName`, `customStyleName`, etc. These JavaScript functions are called by Rust through Node-API, which can cause some performance degradation.

Simple function logic can be replaced by template language. Therefore, for configurations such as `customName`, `customStyleName`, etc., instead of passing functions, you can also pass a string as a template to replace the function, improving performance.

<CH.Spotlight>

```ts
import { MyButton as Btn } from 'foo';
```

---

We will use this piece of code for illustration.

```ts
import { MyButton as Btn } from 'foo';
```

---

Add the following configuration on the right-hand side:


```ts
import moduleImport from '@modern-js/plugin-module-import';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    moduleImport({
      pluginImport: [{
        libraryName: 'foo',
        customName: 'foo/es/{{ member }}'
      }],
    }),
  ],
});
```

---

The `{{ member }}` in it will be replaced with the corresponding import member.

```ts focus=8:8
import moduleImport from '@modern-js/plugin-module-import';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    moduleImport({
      pluginImport: [{
        libraryName: 'foo',
        customName: 'foo/es/{{ member }}'
      }],
    }),
  ],
});
```


---
After transformation:

```ts
import Btn from 'foo/es/MyButton';
```

</CH.Spotlight>


Template `customName: 'foo/es/{{ member }}'` is the same as `` customName: (member) => `foo/es/${member}` ``, but template value has no performance overhead of Node-API.

The template used here is [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com). There are some useful builtin tools, Take the above import statement as an example:


```ts focus=8:8
import moduleImport from '@modern-js/plugin-module-import';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    moduleImport({
      pluginImport: [{
        libraryName: 'foo',
        customName: 'foo/es/{{ kebabCase member }}',
      }],
    }),
  ],
});
```

Transformed to:

```ts
import Btn from 'foo/es/my-button';
```

In addition to kebabCase, there are cameraCase, snakeCase, upperCase and lowerCase can be used as well.
