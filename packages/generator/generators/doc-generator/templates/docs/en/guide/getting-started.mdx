# Getting Started

## 3 minute demo

Want to experience Module Tools in action? The only prerequisite you need is [Node.js LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) and make sure your Node version is **>= 14.17.6**.

From your shell, install the following dependencies in your project.

- `@modern-js/module-tools`
- `@modern-js/plugin-testing`

> If it's a TypeScript project, add the `"typescript"` dependency.

```bash
npm install -D @modern-js/module-tools @modern-js/plugin-testing
```

> For projects that use pnpm or the Yarn package manager, just replace npm. **pnpm is recommended**.

Then add the command `"build": "modern build"` to your project's `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "modern build"
  }
}
```

If your project has a `src/index.(js|jsx)` file or both `src/index.(ts|tsx)` and `tsconfig.json` files, then congratulations you can run the `npm run build` command directly to build your project with Module Tools.

**If you want to see real projects that use the module engineering solution, you can execute the following command**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modern-js-dev/module-tools-examples
cd module-tools-example

## Execute the build.
pnpm build

## Execute the build in listening mode.
pnpm build --watch

## Start Storybook
pnpm dev storybook

## Test
pnpm test
pnpm test
```

**If you want to create a complete module project, you can execute the following command:**

```bash
npx @modern-js/create your-project-dir-name
```

Next, in the issue interaction, follow the options below.

```bash
? Please select the type of project you want to create Module
? Please fill in the project name library
? Please select the development language TS
? Please select the package management tool pnpm
```

> The project name is the value of the `"name"` field in `package.json`.

Then the process of initializing the project will start. After the project directory and files are generated and the dependencies are installed, a complete module project is created.

We can start the project build directly with the `pnpm build` command, and start the build in watching mode with the `pnpm build --watch` command.
