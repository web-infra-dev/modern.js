# Introduction

## Position

Modern.js Doc is a front-end framework for document site scenarios, and its goal is to provide developers with a simple, efficient, and scalable document site solution.

The original intention of this document framework is to provide a ducument solution for the company's internal technical products, and to meet some special internal needs, such as cross-site search services. However, for common document site building needs, we have also provided relatively complete support, such as support for i18n, full-text search, custom themes, and so on.

At the same time, the framework is based on [Modern.js Builder](https://modernjs.dev/builder/), with a variety of built-in optimization strategies to provide better DX.In the near future, we can access to Rust-based bundler **Rspack** through Modern.js Builder.

## Features

### Support MDX

Modern.js Doc is based on [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to extend the Markdown syntax.It supports the use of React components in Markdown, and supports the use of JSX syntax in Markdown, which is more flexible in syntax.

### Support Full-Text Search

### Code Block Syntax Highlighting

Based on [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki) for compile-time code coloring, it supports multiple code language highlighting. For example:

```ts title="modern.config.ts"
import docTools, { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/doc-tools';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  doc: {
    root: path.join(__dirname, 'docs'),
  },
  plugins: [docTools()],
});
```
