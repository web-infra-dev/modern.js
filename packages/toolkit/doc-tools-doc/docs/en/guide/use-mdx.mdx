# Use MDX

Modern.js Doc supports [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a powerful way to develop content.

## Markdown

MDX is a superset of Markdown, which means you can write Markdown files as usual. For example:

```md
# Hello World
```

## Use Component

When you want to use React components in Markdown files, you should name your files with `.mdx` extension. For example:

```mdx
// docs/index.mdx
import { CustomComponent } from './custom';

# Hello World

<CustomComponent />
```

## Front Matter

You can add Front Matter at the beginning of your Markdown file, which is a YAML-formatted object that defines some metadata. For example:

```mdx
---
title: Hello World
---
```

> Note: By default, Modern.js Doc uses h1 headings as html headings.

You can also access properties defined in Front Matter in the body, for example:

```mdx
---
title: Hello World
---

# {frontmatter.title}
```

The previously defined properties will be passed to the component as `frontmatter` properties. So the final output will be:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

## Custom Container

You can use the `:::` syntax to create custom containers and support custom titles. For example:

**Input:**

```markdown
:::tip
This is a `block` of type `tip`
:::

:::info
This is a `block` of type `info`
:::

:::warning
This is a `block` of type `warning`
:::

:::danger
This is a `block` of type `danger`
:::

:::tip Custom Title
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::

:::tip{title="Custom Title"}
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::
```

**Output:**

:::tip
This is a `block` of type `tip`
:::

:::info
This is a `block` of type `info`
:::

:::warning
This is a `block` of type `warning`
:::

:::danger
This is a `block` of type `danger`
:::

:::tip Custom Title
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::

:::tip{title="Custom Title"}
This is a `block` of `Custom Title`
:::

## Code Block

You can use the \`\`\` syntax to create code blocks and support custom titles. For example:

**Input:**

````md
```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

```js title="hello.js"
console.log('Hello World');
```
````

**Output:**

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

```js title="hello.js"
console.log('Hello World');
```
