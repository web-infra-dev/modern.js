## Compile Partial Pages

In multi-page (MPA) projects, the `--entry` option can be added to specify one or more pages to compile. In this way, only part of the code in the project will be compiled, and the dev startup speed will be faster.

For example, execute `modern dev --entry`, the entry selector will be displayed in the command line interface:

```bash
$ modern dev --entry

? Please select the entry that needs to be built
❯ ◯ foo
  ◯ bar
  ◯ baz
```

For example, if you select the `foo` entry, only the code related to the `foo` entry will be compiled, and the code of other pages will not be compiled.

### Specify the page by parameter

You can also specify the page name through parameters after `--entry`, and the names of multiple pages can be separated by commas.

```bash
# Compile foo page
modern dev --entry foo

# Compile foo and bar pages
modern dev --entry foo,bar
```
