Declaring API routing in BFF function mode. Except [some files](/apis/app/hooks/api/functions/api#allow-list)，files in `api/` are registered as routes.

:::info
use `api/` need execute new command to enable the 「BFF」 feature.

:::

:::tip
this file supports the use `js` or `ts`, but the functions must be exported using the ESM syntax.

## Routing Rule

### Default Route

The files named `index` will be upper level routing:

- `api/index.ts` -> `$BASENAME/`
- `api/user/index.ts` -> `$BASENAME/user`

### Multi Level Route

The routing system also supports parsing multiple levels of files. and if you create a folder, the files will still be automatically parsed in the same way.

- `api/hello.ts` -> `$BASENAME/hello`
- `api/user/list.ts` -> `$BASENAME/user/list`

### Dynamic Route

Dynamic named routing parameters can be supported by creating folders or files with `[xxx]`.

- `api/user/[username]/info.ts` -> `$BASENAME/user/:username/info`
- `api/user/[username]/delete.ts` -> `$BASENAME/user/:username/delete`
- `api/article/[id]/info.ts` -> `$BASENAME/article/:id/info`

the `$BASENAME` can be configured in `modern.config.js`，the default value is `/api`.

### Allow List

By default, all files in the `api/` will be parsed as BFF function. but we also set a allow list, and these files will not be parsed:

- file name start with `_`, for example: `_utils.ts`.
- files in directory that name start with `_`, for example：`_utils/index.ts`、`_utils/cp.ts`.
- test files, for example：`foo.test.ts`.
- TypeScript define files, for example：`hello.d.ts`.
- files in `node_module`.

## Define Function

In addition to the above routing rules, the function definition and export in the code also have conventions.

function need named exports，and the name of the exported function is the HTTP Method:

```ts
export const get = async () => {
  return {
    name: 'Modern.js',
    desc: 'Modern web Solutions',
  };
};
```

Export the function like above will generate a `POST` interface.

App support 9 Method definitions: `GET`、`POST`、`PUT`、`DELETE`、`CONNECT`、`TRACE`、`PATCH`、`OPTION`、`HEAD`. so App can use these name as function export nane.

The name is insensitive, whaterver `get`、`Get`、`GEt`、`GET`, can be accurately identified. And default export, `export default xxx` will be `Get` method.

because `delete` is a keyword in JavaScript, use `del` or `DELETE` instead.

Multiple functions of different Methods can be defined in one file, but if multiple functions of the same Method are defined, only the first can work.

:::info
It should be noted that the defined functions should be asynchronous, which is related to the type when the function is called.
