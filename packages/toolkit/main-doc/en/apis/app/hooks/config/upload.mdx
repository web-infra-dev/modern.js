# upload/

Static resource files in any format can be placed in the `upload/`.

## Description

In the development environment, the static resource files in this directory will be hosted in the '/upload' path. After building the application product, the files in this directory will be copied to the dist path.

This file convention is mainly used for developers to use plugins to upload static resource files to the CDN.

## Scene

For example, the SDK used by the project such as `google-analysis.js` (usually requires http caching).

Images, font files, generic CSS, etc.

## Compression

If the file is a `.js` file, it will be automatically compressed when the production environment is built.

If the file ends with `.min.js`, it will not compression.

## More Usage

Whether in [custom HTML](/guides/basic-features/html), or in any HTML file under ['config/public/'](/apis/app/hooks/config/public), you can directly use the HTML tag to refer to the resources in the `config/upload/`:

```html
<script src="/upload/index.js"></script>
```

if [`output.assetPrefix`](/configure/app/output/asset-prefix) is configuredï¼Œadd this prefix directly using template syntax:

```html
<script src="<%=assetPrefix %>/upload/index.js"></script>
```

:::info
Modern.js does not support the use files under `upload/` in `config/public/*.css` via URL.
