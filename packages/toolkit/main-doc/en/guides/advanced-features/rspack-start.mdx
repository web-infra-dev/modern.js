# Rspack Start

[Rspack](https://www.rspack.dev/) is a Rust-based web bundler developed by the ByteDance Web Infra team. The core architecture of Rspack is aligned with the implementation of webpack, and provides out-of-the-box support for commonly used build features.

Rspack optimizes compilation performance by:

- Highly LTO optimized Native code.
- Take full advantage of multi-core, and the entire compilation process is fully optimized for multi-threading.
- On-demand compilation based on request (Lazy Compilation), reducing the number of modules per compilation to improve the speed of cold start.

## Initializing an Rspack project

The Modern.js generator provides an interactive question-and-answer interface to initialize a project. To create an Rspack project, simply select the **Rspack** build tool by running:

import InitRspackApp from "@site-docs-en/components/init-rspack-app"

<InitRspackApp />

After the project is created, you can experience the project by running `pnpm run dev`. For more project information, please refer to [Quick Start](/guides/get-started/quick-start.html).

:::tip
When using Rspack as the bundler, the following features are currently not supported:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static Site Generation (SSG)
- Micro Frontend.
- Storybook debugging.

## Migrating from webpack to Rspack

You can enable Rspack build by running `pnpm run new`:

```bash
$ pnpm run new
? Action： Enable features
? Enable features： Enable Rspack Build
```

After executing the command, enable the Rspack build in `modern.config.ts`:

```ts title=modern.config.ts
import appTools, { defineConfig } from '@modern-js/app-tools';

export default defineConfig<'rspack'>({
  runtime: {
    router: true,
  },
  plugins: [
    appTools({
      bundler: 'experimental-rspack',
    }),
  ],
});
```

:::tip
Migrating from webpack to Rspack may have some differences in build and configuration capabilities. For more details, please refer to [Configuration Differences](https://modernjs.dev/builder/en/guide/advanced/rspack-start.html#migrating-from-webpack-to-rspack).
