# Builder

**Modern.js uses [Modern.js Builder](https://modernjs.dev/builder) to build your Web APP.**

Modern.js Builder is one of the core components of Modern.js. It is a build engine for Web development and can be used independently of Modern.js. Modern.js Builder supports multiple bundlers such as webpack and rspack, and it uses webpack by default.

## Build Architecture

From the perspective of building, Modern.js is divided into three layers, from top to bottom:

- Upper-layer framework: Modern.js.
- Universal build engine: Modern.js Builder.
- Low-level bundlers: webpack and Rspack.
