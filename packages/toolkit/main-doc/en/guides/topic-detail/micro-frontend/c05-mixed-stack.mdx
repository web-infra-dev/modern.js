# Mixed Stack

The Modern.js micro frontend scheme is based on the [Garfish](https://garfishjs.org/) package and provides some more out-of-the-box usage.

When your main application and sub-application are not all Modern.js applications, you can refer to this document.

1. The sub-app is **Modern.js**, the native Garfish micro frontend used by the main app.
2. The main application is **Modern.js**, and some sub-applications have other technology stacks.

## Modern.js Sub App

**Modern.js** subapps compile to generate a standard [Garfish subapp export](https://www.garfishjs.org/guide/start#2%E5%AF%BC%E5%87%BA-provider-%E5%87%BD%E6%95%B0).
So you can directly access the standard micro frontend main application.


:::info
The child application is **Modern.js**, when the main application uses the native Garfish micro frontend, the **child application debugging mode** is not available.

## Modern.js Main App

The Main App is **Modern.js**, and other technology stacks used by sub-applications. Sub-App can be developed according to [Garfish Sub-Application Standard](https://www.garfishjs.org/guide/demo/react).
