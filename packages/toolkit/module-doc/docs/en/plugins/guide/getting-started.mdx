# Quick Start

Module engineering solution not only provides a rich set of features, but also supports extending the capabilities of the current project by way of plugins.

We can quickly see how to write a module-tools plugin by using the following example.

<CH.Spotlight>

```md . /project
. /project .
├── plugins
│ └── example.ts
├── src/
└── modern.config.ts
```

---

First we create `. /plugins/example.ts` file under the initialized project.

```md . /project

```

---

Next add the code for the plugin to the `example.ts` file.

```ts
import type { CliPlugin, ModuleTools } from '@modern-js/module-tools';

export const ExamplePlugin = (): CliPlugin<ModuleTools> => {
  return {
    name: 'example',
    setup() {
      console.info('this is example plugin');
      return {
        // use hooks
        afterBuild() {
          console.info('build over');
        }
      };
    },
  };
};
```

---

Then we register the plugin we just wrote via the [`plugins`](/en/api/config/plugins) API.

```ts . /modern.config.ts
import { examplePlugin } from '. /plugins/example';
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [examplePlugin()],
});
```

---

Finally, run `modern build` and you will see.

```bash terminal
This is example plugin
Build succeed: 510.684ms
build over
```

</CH.Spotlight>

With the above example, we learned the following things.

- The recommended plugin directory structure
- The initialization code of the plugin
- Plugin registration

In addition to the above, we also need to understand.

- [plugin objects, type definitions and recommended configuration items](/en/plugins/guide/plugin-object)
- [setup functions, `api` object parameters, lifecycle hooks](/en/plugins/guide/setup-function)
