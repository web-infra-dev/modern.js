      With routes/ as the convention for entry points, Modern.js automatically
      generates the corresponding routing structure based on the file system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern.js supports the popular conventional routing mode in the industry:
      Nested Routing. When using nested routing, the page's routing corresponds
      to the UI structure, and we will introduce this routing mode in detail.
