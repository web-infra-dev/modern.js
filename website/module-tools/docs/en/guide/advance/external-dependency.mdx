# How to handle third-party dependencies

Generally, third-party dependencies required by a project can be installed via the `install` command in the package manager. After the third-party dependencies are successfully installed, they will generally appear under `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in the project `package.json`.

```json pacakge.json
{
  "dependencies": {},
  "devDependencies": {}
}
```

Dependencies under `"dependencies"` are generally related to project code and builds, and if these third-party dependencies are declared under `"devDependencies"`, then there will be missing dependencies in production environments.

In addition to `"dependencies"`, [`"peerDependencies"`](/en/guide/basic/before-getting-started#peerdependencies) can also declare dependencies that are needed in the production environment, but it puts more emphasis on the existence of these dependencies declared by `"peerDependencies"` in the project's runtime environment, similar to the plugin mechanism.

## Default handling of third-party dependencies

By default, third-party dependencies under `"dependencies"` and `"peerDependencies"` are not packaged in the module project\*\*, so:

<CH.Spotlight>

```json ./v1/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17"
  },
  // or
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^17"
  }
}
```

---

If the project has a dependency on `react`.

```json ./v1/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17"
  },
  // or
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^17"
  }
}
```

---

When a `react` dependency is used in the source code.

```tsx src/index.ts
import React from 'react';
console.info(React);
```

---

The `react` code is not packaged into the product at this point.

```js dist/index.js
import React from 'react';
console.info(React);
```

## Packaging third-party dependencies

However there are cases where you want to package these third-party dependencies into the product. The benefits of packaging third-party dependencies into the product are: **Reducing the time spent downloading third-party dependencies**.

This way of handling third-party dependencies is generally more common in developing command-line tools, which can improve the loading speed of command-line tools and give users a better experience.

So how do you enable the packaging of third-party dependencies in your module project?

The following APIs are provided in the build configuration to handle third-party dependencies:

- [`buildConfig.autoExternal`](/en/api/build-config#autoexternal)
- [`buildConfig.externals`](/en/api/build-config#externals)

### Turn off default behavior

When we want to turn off the default handling behavior for third-party dependencies, we can do so by:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  buildConfig: {
    autoExternal: false,
  },
});
```

This way the dependencies under `"dependencies"` and `"peerDependencies"` will be packaged. If you want to turn off the processing of only one of these dependencies, you can use the
`buildConfig.autoExternal` in the form of an object.

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  buildConfig: {
    autoExternal: {
      dependencies: false,
      peerDependencies: false,
    },
  },
});
```

### Exclude specified third-party dependencies

And in addition to the `buildConfig.autoExternal` API, `buildConfig.externals` can also control which third-party dependencies are to be handled. We can combine these two
APIs to handle the project's dependencies in a more granular way.

For example, when we need to leave only certain dependencies unpacked, we can configure it as follows.

> In this case, it is likely that some dependencies are not suitable for packaging. If this is the case, then you can handle it as follows.

```ts
epxort default defineConfig({
  buildConfig: {
    autoExternal: false,
    externals: ['pkg-1', /pkg-2/],
  }
});
```
