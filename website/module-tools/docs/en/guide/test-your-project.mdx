# Testing Projects

This chapter will describe how to test modules.

## Prerequisites and conventions

To use the testing functionality of the project, you need to make sure that the project contains the following dependencies:

* `"@modern-js/plugin-testing"`

In the module engineering scheme, the following conventions are in place for test cases, or files for writing tests:

* The `tests` directory in the project directory is the directory for test cases and test files, **no support for changing the directory for running test cases**.
* Files with the suffix `.test.[tj]sx?` are automatically recognized as test files by default.
* Other `. [tj]sx?` suffixes are recognized as normal files that can be used as test `utils` files or for other purposes.


## Run the tests

Once the dependencies are prepared and we know where to write the test cases, we can execute the tests with the following command:

``` bash
modern test

// Update snapshot
modern test --updateSnapshot
```

After execution, you will see the results of the test:

![test-result](/test-result.png)

## Usage Configuration

The Module Engineering Program provides the following configurations for testing.

* [`testing`](/zh/api/config-test)

You can add it in `modern.config.(j|t)s`.

## Test example

### Common modules

For common modules, we can use the test function as follows:

<CH.Spotlight>

``` typescript ./src/index.ts
export default function () {
  return 'hello world';
}
```

---

First is the code of the module.

``` typescript ./src/index.ts
export default function () {
  return 'hello world';
}
```

---

Then in the test file, we can do this.

Where `@` points to the source directory, defined in `tests/tsconfig.json` in the initialization project.

``` typescript ./tests/index.test.ts
import main from '@/index';

describe('default cases', () => {
  test('Have returns', () => {
    const drink = jest.fn(main);
    drink();
    expect(drink).toHaveReturned();
  });
});
```

---

Finally we can execute `modern test`.

``` bash
pnpm test
## or
yarn test
## or
npm run test
```

</CH.Spotlight>

### Components

For components, Modern.js's [Runtime API](xxx) provides functionality for testing UI components, which is provided by `@modern-js/runtime/testing`.

:::tip
If you need to use the Runtime API, then you can turn it on via [microgenerator](/zh/guide/command-preview).
:::

<CH.Spotlight>

``` tsx ./src/index.tsx
export const default () {
  return (
    <div>This is a UI Component</div>
  );
}
```

---

First is the code of the component.

``` tsx ./src/index.tsx
export const default () {
  return (
    <div>This is a UI Component</div>
  );
}
```

---

Then in the test file, we can do this.

Where `@` points to the source directory, defined in `tests/tsconfig.json` in the initialization project.

``` tsx ./tests/index.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@modern-js/runtime/testing';

import Component from '@/index';

describe('default cases', () => {
  test('Rendered', () => {
    render(<Component />);
    expect(screen.getByText('This is a UI Component')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

---

Finally we can execute `modern test`.

``` bash
pnpm test
## or
yarn test
## or
npm run test
```
